"""A portable desktop shell for Windows and macOS.

The Linux edition uses GTK 4 with WebKitGTK, which is not available in any
supportable form on Windows or macOS. Everything behind the window is already
portable: the Flask application, the filesystem services and the whole
frontend. Only the shell needed replacing.

This host puts the same private, token-authenticated server behind a system
webview instead:

* Windows uses WebView2, the Edge runtime that ships with current Windows.
* macOS uses WKWebView, part of the operating system.
* Linux can use this host too, through WebKitGTK, but the GTK host remains the
  preferred Linux shell because it also provides native menus, file chooser,
  drag and drop and file associations.

The window is the only difference. Sessions, working images, undo history and
the platform contract behave the same, so a change to shared behaviour cannot
apply to one desktop and not another.

Native file dialogs come from the webview toolkit rather than GTK, so opening
local media still avoids uploading bytes through the browser stack.
