"""Turning ``image.st:AUTO\\FOO.PRG`` into a mounted volume and an inner path.

Every workbench operation names one place inside one image. Rather than pass
a file path and an inner path separately through a dozen call sites, the
engine accepts a single *compound path*: the host file, a colon, then the
GEMDOS path inside it. That mirrors what an Atari user types at a shell
prompt, and it means a command can be logged, repeated and reasoned about as
one string.

Splitting is done by testing candidate prefixes against the filesystem
rather than by finding the first colon, because a host directory may
legitimately contain one and an inner path may legitimately begin with a
drive letter.
