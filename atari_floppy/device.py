"""Direct floppy access through a Linux block device.

This is the adapter for a machine that has a real floppy controller, such as a
Raspberry Pi or a PC with a drive attached, where the disk appears as
``/dev/fd0``. It complements the Greaseweazle adapter rather than replacing it.

The two are not equivalent, and the difference matters when choosing one:

* A floppy controller reads **decoded sectors** at whatever geometry the kernel
  has been told the disk uses. It cannot see anything the controller will not
  decode, so a damaged, copy-protected or unusual disk fails rather than being
  captured.
* Greaseweazle reads **flux**, so it captures a disk whether or not any
  filesystem decoder accepts it.

The difference is sharper on an Atari disk than on a PC one. GEMDOS writes a
whole track at once in its own MFM encoding, eleven 512-byte sectors per side at
double density, without the per-sector gaps a PC controller expects to find. A
standard PC controller cannot decode that at all, so an Atari floppy is captured
through Greaseweazle; this adapter serves controllers and kernels that have been
told the exact geometry, and the CrossDOS-compatible PC disks an Atari also
reads. The kernel geometry must already match the disk, normally through
``setfdprm`` or a device node such as ``/dev/fd0u1760``. This module therefore
verifies what it read against a known geometry and refuses anything that does
not match, instead of handing back a plausible-looking image of the wrong shape.

Nothing here runs a subprocess: the device is read and written directly, so the
module has no dependency on external tooling.
