"""Reading an Atari volume, and copying its contents into another one.

Two things in this application copy a whole volume into a drawer on a second
volume: staging the discs of a title onto the drive it is destined for, and
installing TOS from the Workbench floppies. They were written separately
and came out almost identical, which is the usual way a subtle difference
appears between two paths that were supposed to behave the same.

The steps are the same either way. Read what is already at the destination, so
a file that is there can be recognised without asking the volume about every
name in turn. Walk the source. Spill each file to a host temporary, because the
volume writer takes a batch of host paths and writing the batch in one mount is
what makes a thousand-file disk take a moment rather than minutes. Then create
the drawers that ended up with no files in them, because a drawer an installer
writes into has to exist even when the disc shipped it empty.

Only one thing genuinely differs, and it is what to do about a file that is
already there:

``replace``
    Write it anyway. This is a disc being staged again after correction: the
    newer copy is the point of the exercise.
``skip``
    Leave what is there. This is the second and later disks of an TOS
    release, where the copy order was chosen precisely so that the earlier
    disk wins, and the Workbench disk's full ``C:`` is not overwritten by the
    cut-down copy Extras carries.
``divert``
    Leave what is there, and put a file whose bytes disagree somewhere else so
    that neither is lost. This is a multi-disc set merging into one tree, where
    which copy an installer wants is not knowable from here. A file whose bytes
    are identical is simply skipped; only a real disagreement is diverted.

A file that cannot be read, or whose name the destination will not accept, is
reported rather than raised. One bad file on a floppy should not throw away the
nine hundred that copied, and the caller has somewhere to put the report.
