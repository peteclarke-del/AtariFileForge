"""Read an ISO 9660 CD image, as MetaDOS on an Atari would present one.

A great deal of ST and Falcon material was published on CD, and much more of
it has been mastered onto one since, so a workshop that cannot open an ISO
cannot see any of it. This reads one.

It is read directly from the file rather than loaded into memory, because a CD
image is up to seven hundred megabytes and the interesting ones are already
close to five hundred. A directory listing should not cost half a gigabyte of
resident memory, and an ISO is random access by construction, so seeking is
both cheaper and simpler than holding the whole disc.

Three naming schemes have to be reconciled, and real discs use all of them.
The base ISO name is upper case, eight-and-three by default, and carries a
``;1`` version suffix that nobody wants to see; that is the name MetaDOS
itself hands to a GEMDOS program, which is why it is still read and shown
rather than treated as an implementation detail. **Joliet** publishes proper
names in UCS-2 in a second directory tree. **Rock Ridge** publishes them in an
``NM`` entry attached to the ordinary record.

Joliet is preferred, then Rock Ridge, then the base tree. Nothing hangs off
the base tree's records that would be lost by reading a better name from
elsewhere: the file metadata a disc can carry here is what an entry's own
directory record says, and both trees describe the same files.

A file on a CD is read-only by construction, so every entry reports the
GEMDOS attributes an Atari would see for it: read-only, plus the directory
attribute for a drawer and the hidden attribute when the disc marks the entry
hidden. The recording datestamp comes from the directory record.

The reader is deliberately suspicious of its input. A CD image is a file from
somewhere else, and a malformed or hostile one must not be able to walk this
process into a loop, a hundred-thousand-entry listing or a path that escapes
the disc.
