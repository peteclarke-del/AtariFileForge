"""Read an ISO 9660 CD image, including the Atari extensions Atari CDs use.

TOS 3.5 and 3.9 were published on CD, as were the OS4 releases and a great
deal of other Atari material, so a workshop that cannot open an ISO cannot see
any of it. This reads one.

It is read directly from the file rather than loaded into memory, because a CD
image is up to seven hundred megabytes and the interesting ones here are
already close to five hundred. A directory listing should not cost half a
gigabyte of resident memory, and an ISO is random access by construction, so
seeking is both cheaper and simpler than holding the whole disc.

Three naming schemes have to be reconciled, and real Atari discs use all of
them. The base ISO name is upper case, eight-and-three by default, and carries
a ``;1`` version suffix that nobody wants to see. **Joliet** publishes proper
names in UCS-2 in a second directory tree. **Rock Ridge** publishes them in an
``NM`` entry attached to the ordinary record. The TOS 3.5 disc has Joliet,
the 3.9 disc has Rock Ridge, and the OS4 disc has Rock Ridge with continuation
areas, so all three paths are exercised by discs somebody will actually open.

The one that matters most here is ``AS``, the Atari extension to Rock Ridge. It
carries the file's protection bits and its comment, which is exactly the
metadata this application refuses to lose everywhere else: a loader that
arrives without its ``e`` bit does not run, and the failure looks nothing like
a missing permission. An Atari CD records them, so they are read.

The reader is deliberately suspicious of its input. A CD image is a file from
somewhere else, and a malformed or hostile one must not be able to walk this
process into a loop, a hundred-thousand-entry listing or a path that escapes
the disc.
