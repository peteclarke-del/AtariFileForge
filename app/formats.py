"""File-format declarations shared by upload and image handling.

Extensions are a hint, never a decision: every opened image is identified from
its bytes. What these sets do is decide which probe runs first and which files
the browser offers, so a 400 MiB hard-drive file is not scanned for a
Kickstart ROM before it is scanned for a partition table.

``.adf`` appears in both the OFS and FFS sets on purpose. An Atari floppy
image carries no hint of which filing system formatted it; only its boot block
knows, and that is read at open time.
