"""Reading SPS IPF captures, when the decoder library is installed.

IPF is the Software Preservation Society's preservation format. Unlike an ADF
it records what was actually on the disk, including the timing and the
deliberate irregularities copy protection relies on, which is why a protected
disk survives as an IPF and not as a sector image.

Decoding one needs the SPS decoder library (``libcapsimage``). That library is
source-available under a non-commercial licence and is not ours to ship, so
nothing here bundles it: the workbench looks for it at run time and, when it is
absent, says so plainly instead of failing in an obscure way. Installing it is
documented in ``docs/IPF-GUIDE.md``.

What the library returns is a track's MFM bit cells, not its files. Turning
those into an ADF is done here, in the ordinary Atari way: find each sector's
sync mark, split the odd and even bit planes the format interleaves, and check
the header and data checksums before accepting a sector. A sector that does not
check out is reported rather than written, because a preservation image is
exactly where a silently wrong byte does the most damage.
