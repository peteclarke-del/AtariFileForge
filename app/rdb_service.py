"""Rigid Disk Block hard drives, addressed as the partitions they declare.

An Atari hard drive describes itself. Block 0 carries an ``RDSK`` block, which
chains to one ``PART`` block per partition, and each of those names a device
(``DH0:``, ``Work:``) and gives the geometry and filing system of the volume
inside it. That is how a real machine finds its drives at boot, and it is the
only description this workbench trusts: nothing here assumes a fixed number of
partitions, a fixed partition size, or a fixed place for the partition table.

A drive is therefore opened as a list of partitions, and one of them is
selected. Everything downstream - listing, reading, editing, validating - then
works on that partition exactly as it works on a floppy, because a partition is
an ordinary GEMDOS volume that happens to start part way into a larger file.
