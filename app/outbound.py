"""One policy for every request this application makes to the network.

The online library and the metadata lookup both fetch URLs, and the catalogue
sources are editable through the API. Without a check, anyone who can reach the
service could point it at an address only the server can see: another container,
a router's admin page, or a cloud instance-metadata endpoint. The Compose file
publishes port 8666 on every interface, so that is not purely theoretical on a
shared network.

Requests are therefore restricted to ``http`` and ``https`` and to addresses
that are publicly routable. A host that resolves to a loopback, private,
link-local, reserved or multicast address is refused before any connection is
made.

A local mirror of an archive is a legitimate setup, so the restriction can be
lifted deliberately with ``ATARI_ALLOW_PRIVATE_SOURCES=1``. It is opt-in
because the safe default should not depend on the operator noticing.

This narrows the target set; it is not a complete defence. A name that resolves
to a public address at validation and a private one at connection time would
still pass, and defeating that needs the resolved address to be pinned through
to the socket. That is a deliberate limit, recorded so nobody assumes more
protection than exists.
