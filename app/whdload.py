"""What this build knows about WHDLoad, and how it puts it on a hard disk.

WHDLoad is how most Atari games and demos are made to run from a hard drive.
It comes in two halves and only one of them can be fetched automatically, so
the split is worth stating plainly because it shapes everything downstream.

The **program** is a single archive published by its author at whdload.de.
That address answers a plain request, carries the current release, and is
ahead of the Aminet copy, so it is the first source tried and Aminet is the
fallback.

A **slave** is the small per-title patch that teaches WHDLoad one game. Those
are not fetchable: whdload.de refuses ``/games/`` to anything that is not a
browser session, and Aminet does not carry them. Nothing here pretends
otherwise. A slave reaches an image because it is already in the image, or
because the operator points at a folder of them, or because they drop one in.
Guessing a download address for a title would produce a confident failure at
the worst moment, which is halfway through writing a disk.

Installing the program is deliberately done by copying files rather than by
running the archive's own ``Install`` script under emulation. The script's job
is to ask where things go and then copy them; the destinations are fixed and
known, so booting an emulator to rediscover them would cost a minute per image
and add a way to fail that copying does not have.
