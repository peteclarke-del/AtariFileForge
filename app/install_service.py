"""Installing a floppy into a hard disk, rather than only copying it there.

Copying a game disk into an HDF gives you the files. It does not give you
something that runs: the title still expects to be booted from DF0:, and the
hard drive still has no idea the title exists. Closing that gap is what this
component is for, and there are only four honest ways to do it.

**Staging** extracts the discs of a title into a drawer *on the drive being
built*, merging a multi-disc set into a single tree the way an installer would
see it in a drawer. Nothing is emulated and nothing is guessed at, so it always
works and it is always fast. Putting it on the target image rather than in a
directory on this machine is the whole point: the operator boots the drive in
an emulator, or puts it in a real Atari, and finishes the job there with the
discs already in front of them. This is the default because it is the only
mode that cannot half-succeed.

**Workbench** is the one install this application can perform in full, because
TOS is installed by copying disks into known places rather than by running
code (see ``app.workbench_install``). Given the operator's own Workbench
floppies it prepares a drive that boots.

**WHDLoad** is the right answer for most games and demos, and the program half
of it can be installed here directly. The per-title slave cannot be fetched
from anywhere (see ``app.whdload``), so this mode installs WHDLoad, stages the
disc content under the title's drawer, and places a slave only when one was
supplied. An install without a slave is reported as incomplete rather than
presented as finished.

**The title's own installer** cannot be second-guessed at all. Productivity
software asks questions this application has no answer to, so that mode boots
the emulator with the drive and the disc attached and gets out of the way.

Every mode here changes a drive an operator may have spent a long time
building, so each one is reached through a route that declares itself an image
mutation and therefore gets an undo checkpoint before it runs. The checkpoint
is not taken in this module: putting it in one place, at the boundary, is what
stops a new entry point from quietly arriving without one.
