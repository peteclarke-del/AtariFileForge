"""Preparing a drive by installing TOS onto it from the Workbench floppies.

A blank hard drive is not a machine you can use. Before a title can be
installed, or a Shell opened, or an icon double-clicked, the drive has to carry
an operating system, and the only lawful source of one is the operator's own
Workbench disks. This installs them.

TOS is unusual in being installable without running any Atari code. The
Install disk's script does ask questions - which printer, which language - but
the part that produces a working system is a copy: Workbench and Extras merge
into the root of the drive, and Fonts, Locale, Storage, Classes and Backdrops
become drawers of their own. That is a job this application can do in full and
correctly, which is why it is offered as an install rather than as a staging
drawer the operator has to finish by hand.

Disks are recognised by the **volume name inside the image** rather than by
file name. ADF collections are named inconsistently - ``wb31_workbench.adf``,
``Workbench 3.1 (Disk 2 of 6).adf``, ``disk02.adf`` - and a renamed file says
nothing at all about its contents, while the volume name is written by
Commodore and travels with the data.

The release is decided once, from the Workbench disk, and every other disk is
then matched against it. Mixing releases is the classic way to end up with a
drive that boots to a Guru: a 2.0 Extras drawer on a 3.1 system, or a Locale
disk from a release that had no Locale, produces a system whose parts disagree
about what the others provide.

Where two disks carry the same file, the first one copied wins, and the order
is fixed so that the winner is the right one: the Workbench disk is copied
before Extras so that its full ``C:``, ``L:`` and ``Libs:`` are not overwritten
by the cut-down copies the other disks carry. The Install disk is kept in its
own drawer for exactly the same reason.

This follows the layout the TOS 3.x install script produces, which is also
what the PiStorm imager writes, so a drive prepared here looks to a person and
to a program like one prepared the usual way.
