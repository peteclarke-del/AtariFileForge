"""Managed emulator selection and command construction.

The workbench can hand an image to an emulator so a change can be watched
running rather than only inspected. FS-UAE is the one supported emulator: it
covers every machine from an A500 to an A4000 and the CD32, it takes floppies
and hard drives alike, and it is driven entirely from the command line, which
is what makes a test run repeatable and scriptable on every platform this
application runs on.

No Kickstart ROM is shipped or downloaded. Each emulator needs one that the
user supplies, and a profile that cannot find its ROM reports that plainly
instead of starting and failing at a black screen.
