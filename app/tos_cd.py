"""Recognising the TOS release CDs, and saying whether a drive can take one.

TOS 3.5 and 3.9 were published on CD rather than on floppies, and they are
not installed the way 3.1 is. There is no tree to copy: the disc carries a
Commodore Installer script of two hundred kilobytes that runs on the Atari,
reads the versions of the libraries the live system has loaded, asks a great
many questions and patches an existing installation in place. Its own words
are that "Pretend mode cannot be used with this installation script", and 3.9
refuses outright unless it finds an earlier release already there.

So this component does not install anything. It does the three things that can
be done honestly from outside the Atari, and which otherwise cost an operator a
long detour to discover:

**Recognise the disc.** The volume name is exact and Commodore wrote it, so a
disc is identified the same way the Workbench floppies are, and a disc that is
merely a coverdisk or a contribution CD is not mistaken for a release.

**Check the hardware.** Both releases need a 68020 or better. A stock A500 or
A600 cannot run either, and there is no point booting an emulator for twenty
minutes to be told so. An A1200 qualifies on its own, and so does any machine
with an accelerator or a PiStorm, which is exactly what the hardware profiles
already describe.

**Check the target.** 3.5 wants Kickstart 3.1 and a Workbench already
installed; 3.9 wants a release already there to update. A drive that has
neither is not ready, and saying so before the emulator starts is the whole
value of a preflight.

What happens after that is the emulator booting the drive with the CD attached,
and Commodore's installer doing the work. That is the honest division: this
application prepares and checks, and the installer installs.
