"""Shared policy for the flux containers HxCFE can decode and re-encode.

HFE and SCP are different files but the same workflow: decode the flux to raw
sectors, identify the Atari filesystem inside, prove the sectors re-encode and
decode back byte-for-byte before permitting any edit, and prove it again before
handing the user a saved image.

That policy lived twice in ``disk_service``, once per container, and the two
copies had already drifted: only the HFE save path restored an omitted tail
sector, so saving an edited double-density SCP failed its own verification. Expressing
the rules once here means a container cannot quietly miss a fix made for its
sibling, and lets the geometry rules be unit tested without an HxCFE binary.

Nothing in this module runs a subprocess itself. ``FluxEngine`` is handed the
caller's ``run_hxcfe`` so the disk service keeps ownership of process
execution, error translation and timeouts.
