"""Browsing a CD image as an ordinary pane, and copying things off it.

A CD is read-only by nature, so this mixin offers listing and reading and
nothing else. That puts it beside the DMS component rather than beside the
filing systems: both are containers an operator opens to take things out of,
and neither can be written back.

The Atari metadata a disc records is carried through into the same fields an
GEMDOS volume reports, so a file dragged off a CD arrives with the
protection bits and comment the disc gave it. Getting that right is the whole
reason for reading the Atari extension at all, and it is what makes copying
from a CD equivalent to copying from a floppy rather than a lossy import.
