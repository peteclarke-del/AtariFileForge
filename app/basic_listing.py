"""Turning a saved ST BASIC program back into readable lines.

ST BASIC stores a program tokenised, not as text: each keyword is one or two
bytes and only names and literals survive as characters. Reading one therefore
means running the token tables backwards, which is work the ``atarinut.basic``
package owns. This module is the single place the workbench asks it to do that,
so a listing shown in the file inspector, the editor and a report all come from
the same decode.

Anything that is not a saved ST BASIC program returns ``None``, rather than a
list of lines assembled out of coincidence.
