"""Reading an GEMDOS volume's catalogue directly, and repairing its loaders.

Two jobs live here, and both exist because mounting a volume is more work than
the question deserves. Menu scanning wants to know what is on 511 disks, and a
compatibility check wants to know what one loader will do. Both are answered by
reading the root block's hash table straight out of the image bytes.

The loader repairs are the compatibility half. Software written for a floppy
refers to ``DF0:`` and relies on the stack a startup script set; installed on a
hard drive, both are wrong. Every repair here is length-preserving, so a file's
extent and a script's line structure are unchanged by it.
