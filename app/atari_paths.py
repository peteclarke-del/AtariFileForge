"""The one place Atari File Forge builds and takes apart inner paths.

An GEMDOS path separates its components with ``/`` and names its volume root
with a bare ``:``. The separator matters: Atari filenames routinely contain
full stops -- ``Startup-Sequence`` sits beside ``Disk.info`` and ``game.exe``
in the same drawer -- so a dot cannot be a separator without corrupting
ordinary names.

Requests that arrive from an older client, a saved workspace or a stored
recipe may still spell the root ``$``. Those are accepted and normalised here
rather than being handled again at each call site.
