"""Describe the GEMDOS layout exposed by a mounted volume.

The pane needs to know four things before it lets a user type a name or
create a directory: which filing-system variant this is, whether names are
folded with the international rules, whether the volume keeps a directory
cache, and how long a name may be. All four come from the boot block's DOS
type and the mounted volume, not from the file extension, because an ``.adf``
says nothing about the filing system inside it.
