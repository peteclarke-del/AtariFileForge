                <li>Enter a disk title. For HDA, HDF and RAW images, enter a capacity such as <code>20MB</code> or <code>512MB</code>.</li>
                <li>The size field is read-only for the fixed floppy geometries, because an Atari DS/DD floppy is always 880 KiB and the high-density format an A3000 or A4000 drive writes is always 1760 KiB. It becomes editable for Hardfile, RDB and RAW hard drives and remembers the last capacity you entered.</li>
                <li>The target is disabled when it does not apply, fixed to Hardfile for HDA/GEO, and fixed to Atari 4000 / TOS for RDB or RAW. Floppies retain a target choice because the same 880 KiB disk is used by every Atari from the 1000 to the 4000.</li>
                <li>A partitioned drive takes its title from the volume in its first partition, so that is the name you enter here.</li>

            <h3>Linux desktop application</h3>
            <p class="help-lead">The Linux edition is the same Atari File Forge workbench in a native GTK 4 window. Format support, editors, validation and saved packages stay aligned with the Docker edition.</p>
            <div class="help-task">
              <h4>Install and launch</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>Stable releases provide separate Debian 13 and Ubuntu 24.04 packages for AMD64, ARM64 and ARMv7. Install the matching <code>.deb</code> with APT, for example <code>sudo apt install ./atari-file-forge_0.0.0-1~deb13_amd64.deb</code>. APT installs the required Python 3, GTK 4, Libadwaita, WebKitGTK 6 and GObject packages.</li>
                <li>For development from a project checkout, install those system packages and run <code>tools/install-linux-desktop.sh</code> instead.</li>
                <li>Launch <strong>Atari File Forge</strong> from the application menu. The package command is <code>atari-file-forge</code>; a checkout uses <code>tools/atari-file-forge-desktop</code>.</li>
                <li>Use the native folder button, <strong>File → Open image</strong> in a pane or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> to select one or several images with the GTK chooser. You can also drag image files from the Linux file manager onto a pane. Native selection and drag and drop pass local paths to the private desktop service, so image bytes are not uploaded through the embedded browser.</li>
                <li>Drop an HDA and its matching GEO together, or select either member when its companion is beside it. Multiple ADF, ADZ, HFE, DMS, HDF, ROM and other recognised images open into successive available panes.</li>
                <li>Review the selection before it opens. The active Workbench profile supplies the initial FFS target, which can be changed for this operation. Multiple ROM files may be opened separately or treated as one linear or byte-interleaved physical component set.</li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <ul>
              <li>HDA and GEO partners with the same basename are paired automatically.</li>
              <li>Chooser, file-association and file-manager selections use one serial opening queue, so two large images cannot race while their private sessions are created.</li>
              <li>The selected source is cloned by the filesystem when possible, or sparse-copied once into XDG application storage. The original is not changed in place.</li>
              <li>Large Hardfile HDA files bypass browser upload and spooling. The former pause near 24 percent was the embedded browser transferring the HDA, not FFS analysis. Expensive hardware finalisation remains deferred to Save and reports its stages there.</li>
              <li>GTK and Libadwaita supply the title bar, window controls, application menu, chooser and symbolic header icons. The workbench inherits the desktop font and initially follows the system light or dark setting.</li>
              <li>A stable private owner recovers this Linux user's working sessions. Workspace settings, hardware profiles and the private collection catalogue are stored atomically under the XDG configuration directory, so a new random-port launch does not lose them.</li>
              <li>Saved ZIPs use the normal Linux Downloads directory and contain the same image, sidecars and README as the web edition.</li>
              <li>Managed emulators appear as native windows. In Docker they continue to appear in the browser display.</li>
              <li>Install the optional official Greaseweazle tools to write ADF, ADZ, FFS floppy and HFE images to real disks.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="help-task"><h4>Write a physical floppy with Greaseweazle</h4><ol>
              <li>Confirm <code>gw info</code> can see the connected device and that the Linux udev rules permit access.</li>
              <li>Open a supported floppy image.</li>
              <li>Choose <strong>Tools → Write physical floppy</strong>, or right-click the image title or coloured format badge.</li>
              <li>Select drive A, B, 0, 1, 2 or 3, insert the destination disk, then acknowledge that every existing byte on it will be overwritten.</li>
              <li>Follow the live cylinder, head and verification progress. Abort stops Greaseweazle, but leaves the physical disk potentially incomplete; the working image remains unchanged.</li>
              <li>Keep a sector disk only after the completion dialog confirms verification. HFE contains raw bitcells and cannot be automatically verified, so test that disk on suitable hardware.</li>
            </ol></div>
            <div class="help-note"><strong>Stable source:</strong> the working image is finalised and copied to a private snapshot before the physical write begins. Later edits cannot alter an in-progress disk, and the temporary image and its snapshot are removed afterwards.</div>
            <div class="help-note"><strong>One product, two hosts:</strong> the desktop application embeds the shared frontend and starts the shared API on a private random loopback port. A fresh launch token protects it, a separate mode-0600 owner identifies its sessions, and native-only path and state adapters are not exposed by the web host.</div>
            <div class="help-note"><strong>Icon opens no window:</strong> pull the current code and rerun <code>tools/install-linux-desktop.sh</code>. The launcher detects Ubuntu systems that deny WebKitGTK's Bubblewrap user namespace and enables the compatibility fallback only there. Set <code>ATARI_FILE_FORGE_DISABLE_WEBKIT_SANDBOX=0</code> to require sandboxing or <code>1</code> for diagnostic fallback. Run <code>~/.local/bin/atari-file-forge</code> in a terminal if startup diagnostics are still needed.</div>
            <div class="help-warning"><strong>Updating:</strong> install a newer <code>.deb</code> over the release package, or pull the new source and rerun the checkout installer when Python dependencies change. Working sessions remain under <code>~/.local/share/atari-file-forge</code>, or the configured XDG data directory.</div>

            <h3>Workspace, navigation and selection</h3>
            <figure><img src="/help/workspace.png" alt="Atari File Forge showing movable image panes and the Add Pane control"><figcaption>The workspace begins with one pane. Add and arrange as many movable image windows as the computer can comfortably display; each retains independent navigation, selection, refresh, progress and save controls.</figcaption></figure>
            <h4>Add, arrange and close panes</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Select <strong>Add Pane</strong> in the header to add an empty cascading window. There is no fixed pane-count limit.</li>
              <li>Drag an empty part of a pane heading, or use the numbered grip at its left, to move it. Windows may overlap, and selecting any part of a window brings it to the front.</li>
              <li>Drag a pane to the left or right edge to fill that half, to a corner to fill that quarter, or to the top edge to maximise it. The translucent preview shows the result before release.</li>
              <li>Drag any pane edge or corner to resize it. A snapped pane begins resizing from its visible snapped rectangle rather than jumping back to its earlier size. The lower-right corner has a visible resize mark. Double-click the numbered grip or use the square heading button to maximise or restore it.</li>
              <li>When the browser or workspace changes size, free panes scale proportionally to remain useful and visible. Snapped panes continue to follow their selected side or corner.</li>
              <li>Select the line button to minimise a pane to the shelf at the bottom of the workspace. Select its shelf button to restore and focus it.</li>
              <li>With the numbered grip focused, use Alt+Left or Alt+Right to snap, Alt+Up to maximise, and Alt+Down to minimise without a pointer. Hold Shift as well to resize in 32-pixel steps.</li>
              <li>An empty pane is a convenient scratch area for creating an ADF, ADZ, HDF, FFS floppy, Hardfile HDA/GEO pair or other supported image.</li>
              <li>Select × at the top-right to close that whole pane. Save changed images from the prompt, deliberately close without saving a download, or cancel. The server working copy remains available through Recovery.</li>
              <li>Open images, positions, sizes, snap layout, stacking order and minimised windows are remembered across a normal page refresh. A completely fresh workspace starts with one pane.</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="help-note"><strong>Two different drag operations:</strong> drag a heading or its numbered grip to move or snap the window. Drag file rows or the coloured format badge on a supported disk image to transfer content between images.</div>
            <div class="help-note"><strong>Familiar pane menus:</strong> File and Edit are always first, followed by View, Library, Analyse and Tools. File holds open, save, add and create commands. Edit holds Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo and Checkpoints. View holds refresh and the command that returns to a drive&rsquo;s partition table. The heading icons remain quick shortcuts for common image actions.</div>
            <div class="help-note"><strong>Free-space meter:</strong> the lower-right bar uses the image filesystem's real allocation data. Green means under 70% used, orange means 70% or more, and red means 90% or more. Hover over it for used, free and total values. A drive's partition table counts allocated space; opening a partition switches the meter to that volume's OFS bytes. DMS archives have no fixed free-space capacity and show a neutral striped meter.</div>
            <h4>Navigate an image</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Double-click a directory to enter it. Double-click a file to open the BASIC, script, text, disassembly or hex editor selected from its contents.</li>
              <li>Double-click <strong>..</strong> to move to the parent directory, or select any breadcrumb to jump directly to that location.</li>
              <li>Inside a partition, use <strong>All partitions</strong> to return to the partition table. The partition you left remains selected and is scrolled back into view.</li>
              <li>Select ↻ in the pane heading to reread the current directory or partition table without closing the image.</li>
              <li>Click the image filename in the pane heading to edit it. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or click elsewhere to save, or press <kbd>Escape</kbd> to cancel. The format extension is retained; HDA/GEO pair names stay matched. This renames the recovered and downloaded container, not its internal disk title.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Select one or several items</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Click an item to select only it.</li>
              <li>Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>-click to add or remove individual items.</li>
              <li>Use <kbd>Shift</kbd>-click to select the range between the anchor and the clicked row.</li>
              <li>Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>-<kbd>A</kbd> while a row has focus to select every usable item in the current view.</li>
              <li>Start dragging any selected row to carry the complete selection.</li>
              <li>Point at a single row to reveal Rename and Delete beside its name. For a multiple selection, Rename is hidden and Delete applies to the whole selection with one confirmation.</li>
              <li>The Access column reveals separate read/write and read-only controls. They apply to one file or disk, or every applicable item in a multiple selection.</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="help-note"><strong>The orange dot means changed:</strong> the working image contains edits not yet downloaded. It clears after Save Image has successfully prepared the download and returns after the next edit. A failed save leaves the dot visible. It does not mean the original file has changed.</div>

                <li>At file level, read the <strong>Protection</strong>, <strong>Comment</strong> and <strong>Date</strong> columns. These are the three things GEMDOS records about a file, and they come from the image rather than being guessed from its bytes.</li>
                <li>Protection is shown the way <code>List</code> shows it, as the eight letters <code>hsparwed</code>. A letter means the bit is set; a dash means it is not.</li>
                <li>The low four bits are stored inverted, so an ordinary file that can be read, written, executed and deleted stores <code>0x00</code> and reads <code>----rwed</code>, while a locked one stores <code>0x05</code> and reads <code>----r-e-</code>. The editor works in the letters, because the inversion is where mistakes are made.</li>
                <li>Select the protection value to change it. The comment is up to 79 characters and the datestamp is the volume's own, counted from 1 January 1978.</li>
                <li>Changes are written into the file header. The file's own bytes are not rewritten.</li>

Existing supported HFE images open through the normal image picker.</figcaption></figure>
            <p>HFE stores floppy track timing and bit cells, while OFS and FFS describe files inside the sectors. Atari File Forge uses the official HxCFloppyEmulator command-line converter, <code>hxcfe</code>, to decode those sectors and then opens the detected filing system. A supported HFE is not merely recognised: its decoded catalogue is browseable through the normal pane. Docker images and native Debian/Ubuntu packages include a pinned, architecture-native HxCFE build and its supporting libraries. No separate HxC installation is required.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Open an HFE normally, or create an HFE-wrapped OFS/FFS floppy from <strong>File → New → New Image</strong>.</li>
              <li>Check the opening warning. A clean HFE v1 disk is editable through the usual file tools.</li>
              <li>HFE v2/v3, weak-bit, bad-sector, protected or advanced timing images open as a clearly labelled read-only safe view. Export or drag files from them without changing their tracks.</li>
              <li>For an editable HFE, make the required changes and select <strong>Save Image</strong> in the pane heading.</li>
              <li>The app writes changed sectors into a copy of the original track layout, decodes that result, and compares every sector with the working filesystem. A mismatch blocks the download and leaves the original HFE intact.</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="help-note"><strong>What the pane shows:</strong> the format badge reads HFE, while the directory rules, geometry and capacity come from its decoded OFS or FFS filesystem. Advanced images show <strong>Read-only safe view</strong> and hide editing and compaction controls.</div>
            <div class="help-note"><strong>Transfers:</strong> any supported HFE filesystem can be opened in one pane and copied or extracted into another image. A sector image holds only sectors, so the timing, weak-bit and protection information an advanced HFE carries is deliberately omitted and reported as a destination warning.</div>
            <div class="help-task"><h4>How saving is verified</h4><ol>
              <li>HxCFE encodes the changed sectors into a new HFE, using the original track layout as a reference where applicable.</li>
              <li>HxCFE decodes the candidate output again.</li>
              <li>Atari File Forge byte-compares the decoded result with the complete working filesystem.</li>
              <li>A mismatch blocks the download and preserves the original HFE. A successful HFE is added to the timestamped save package.</li>
            </ol></div>
            <div class="help-note"><strong>Installed Linux runtime:</strong> the private HxCFE executable is <code>/opt/atari-file-forge/native/bin/hxcfe</code> and its libraries are under <code>/opt/atari-file-forge/native/lib</code>.

              <li>Wait while HxCFE decodes the flux revolutions. Atari File Forge identifies the recovered sectors as OFS or FFS, restores a single omitted blank tail sector when HxCFE exhibits its known final-sector behaviour, then validates the complete filesystem.</li>
              <li>Browse the normal catalogue and directory hierarchy. The pane badge remains <strong>SCP</strong>, while the file rules follow the recovered filesystem.</li>
              <li>Select <strong>File → Export as…</strong>, or the <strong>Export</strong> control in the pane header between <strong>Save Image</strong> and <strong>Refresh View</strong>, and choose the native sector image. A recovered DS/DD disk downloads as a 901,120-byte <code>.adf</code> image, or as the same image gzipped to <code>.adz</code>. The header control is greyed out when the open media has no compatible target.</li>
            </ol></div>
            <div class="help-note"><strong>Safety boundary:</strong> recognition of a root directory is not enough. The app rejects an SCP capture if the full Atarinut filesystem validator finds a broken map, catalogue or directory tree. Non-standard index timing is reported but does not block a capture whose recovered sectors validate completely.</div>
            <div class="help-note"><strong>Editing:</strong> before enabling writes, the app re-encodes the recovered sectors to SCP and decodes them again.

            <h3>ROM images: banks, headers and chip sets</h3>
            <p class="help-lead">A ROM is a byte image rather than a filing system. The pane divides it into explicit banks without changing the saved bytes.</p>
            <figure><img src="/help/rom-pane.png" alt="ROM pane showing bank address, decoded identity, purpose, entry points and programmed utilisation"><figcaption>The main pane is a bank inventory, not a directory. At narrow pane widths each bank becomes a readable two-column card while retaining the same decoded fields.</figcaption></figure>
            <div class="help-note"><strong>Terms used in the pane:</strong> <em>Bank</em> is the zero-based logical block selected by the configured bank size. <em>File address</em> is its byte offset in the complete image. <em>Mapped address</em> is the conventional CPU window for the selected target. <em>Programmed</em> means bytes that differ from the configured erased value; it is not filesystem free space.</div>
            <div class="help-task"><h4>Open and inspect a ROM</h4><ol>
              <li>Open a <code>.rom</code>, numbered <code>.rom0</code> to <code>.rom7</code>, or a <code>.bin</code> carrying a recognised Atari ROM header. For a headerless or generically named dump, choose the Atari ROM raw-format override in the open dialog.</li>
              <li>The default view uses 16 KiB banks. Choose <strong>Tools → ROM layout</strong> if the device uses 8K, 32K or another 256-byte-aligned bank size.</li>
              <li>Read the bank inventory from left to right: bank and image address, decoded identity, purpose and entry points, then programmed contents. An Atari-family bank also shows its mapped CPU window. Empty and unrecognised banks are labelled plainly.</li>
              <li>The guidance strip above the inventory explains the shortcuts. Select ⓘ for decoded information, double-click for Hex, or open <strong>Tools → ROM Workbench</strong> for disassembly, comparison and hardware preparation.</li>
              <li>Image Health recognises Atari-family headers and the standard TOS <code>ExtnROM0</code> trailer. A bad TOS extension-ROM checksum is reported as a failure.</li>
              <li>Select ⓘ on a bank to open its decoded-content view. It shows header fields, processor type, declared feature bits, mapped entry points, known regions and bounded printable strings with their byte offsets and mapped addresses.</li>
              <li>Use <strong>Resident modules</strong> in that view to see the libraries, devices and resources the ROM makes available, with the node type, version and priority each tag declares.</li>
              <li>A <strong>?</strong> beside a module shows the identification string its tag points at. Point at it, focus it from the keyboard, or select it to keep the tooltip open. The source label distinguishes a declared tag, a signature reconstructed from a table, and a literal string recovered from the ROM. Press <kbd>Escape</kbd> to close pinned help.</li>
              <li>An Atari expansion ROM has no single standard module catalogue. The app recognises coherent resident-module name and vector tables. A vector table must also have a 68000 code reference and valid handlers inside the ROM's own address window.</li>
              <li>Printable text alone is not included, because help text, examples and even machine code can resemble a name. A vector table provides separate Table and Handler buttons, and a name table links to its own entry. These links open a hex editor inside the decoded-information dialog; closing it reveals the same information at its previous scroll position. Hex editing opened from a pane menu stays inside that pane.</li>
              <li>If no module is shown, the ROM may still install one: a tag can be built at run time, or laid out in a way the static scanner does not recognise. Check the machine's own module list on suitable hardware, or inspect the initialisation routine in the hex editor.</li>
              <li>Printable strings can also reveal messages and build information, but are labelled as evidence rather than guessed files. Every decoded location and command has a direct Hex button.</li>
              <li>The decoder also reports SHA-256, CRC-32, entropy, distinct byte values, erased space, used range, programming offsets and identical banks. Header flags are checked against the actual entry vectors.</li>
              <li>For an Atari 4000 target, plausible TOS module headers expose titles, help text, entry facilities and SWI information. They remain labelled as candidates unless the enclosing ROM structure proves them.</li>
              <li>A recognised Atari, Master or Atari 600 header shows its title, version and language/service roles. TOS extension images show their <code>ExtnROM0</code> size and checksum trailer. Unknown custom data remains honestly labelled as raw code and data.</li>
              <li>Double-click a bank to open the hex editor at that bank's first byte. Use the image health dashboard to report partial banks and recognised headers.</li>

              <li>Use 512 KiB for a Kickstart 2.0 or later ROM, 256 KiB for Kickstart 1.3, or 8 to 32 KiB for an expansion ROM. Enter a title of up to eight characters, the version byte and an Atari copyright string beginning with <code>(C)</code>.</li>
              <li>Create the image, then use <strong>File → Insert File</strong>, folder import, drag and drop, or cross-pane Copy and Paste to populate it.</li>

            <p class="help-lead">An Atari hard drive describes itself. Block 0 carries a Rigid Disk Block, which chains to one partition block for every partition, and each of those names the device the partition mounts as, its filing system and its size. Atari File Forge reads that description and shows you the drive exactly as a machine would see it at boot.</p>

                <li>Removing one exports the open partition as a bare <code>.hdf</code> with its geometry written beside it as a <code>.geo</code>, both inside a <code>Hardfile0</code> directory. The two files are only usable together: once the partition table is gone, the sidecar is the only place the geometry exists.</li>
                <li>The working image is not changed either way. The conversion downloads as a separate file, which you can open in another pane to check before using it.</li>

            <p class="help-lead">The Online Library uses the same format checks, metadata review and undo point as a file selected from your computer. A link is never treated as an installable image unless its source provides a direct supported download.</p>
            <div class="help-task"><h4>Install software into a drive or a floppy</h4><ol>
              <li>Open the destination: a partition on a hard drive, or a floppy image.</li>
              <li>Choose <strong>Library → Find software online</strong>. Its initial machine comes from the Workbench profile applied to this pane, or the remembered active Workbench profile when the pane has none. Change it when this search needs another machine, then search by title, publisher or keyword. Leave the search blank to browse the current catalogue page. Search results remain installable for one hour and survive a normal app restart.</li>
              <li>Select the <strong>Title</strong>, <strong>Publisher</strong>, <strong>Year</strong> or <strong>Source</strong> heading to sort. The active heading shows ↑ for ascending or ↓ for descending; select it again to reverse the order. Checked results stay selected while sorting.</li>
              <li>Use <strong>Not already present</strong> to hide likely matches found by disk title, or a remembered online distribution name. The comparison ignores punctuation and the publisher suffix saved with online imports. This is a helpful duplicate check, not a checksum guarantee.</li>
              <li>The initial results contain only records whose supported media has been verified. Large indexes are checked in bounded groups. Choose <strong>Find more downloadable results</strong> until the status says every matching catalogue entry has been checked. Existing results and selections are retained. Shared <strong>Atari/Atari 600</strong> releases are included in both machine families.</li>
              <li>Select several downloadable results. Each one's expanded size is measured against the destination's free space before anything is written, so a batch that will not fit is reported before its first write rather than part way through.</li>
              <li>Review the title, publisher, launcher and action detected for each item after insertion, together with the stack its launcher needs. Every proposal carries the evidence behind it, and an ambiguous one is marked rather than written silently.</li>
              <li>During a multi-item install, <strong>Abort operation</strong> stops before the next download. The item already in progress finishes at a safe image boundary. The foreground status reports elapsed time, measured item throughput and an ETA once enough completed work exists to calculate them honestly.</li>
              <li>If an archive contains the same release as both ADF and DMS, the native ADF is selected once. Installing into a blank ADF adopts its catalogue and title; shortened ADF files are safely padded to the target's standard geometry.</li>

              <li>On OFS, ordinary single-catalogue downloads are copied into the currently open group. Multi-prefix distributions retain their original OFS prefixes so loaders and duplicate leaf names remain valid.</li>
              <li>On FFS, a downloaded disk is extracted into the current directory by default. Select <strong>Create a folder</strong> to keep each disk separate.

A fresh short-lived download is requested when Install is selected.</li>
              <li>Choose <strong>Sources…</strong> to edit a provider's URL, loading strategy, page layout, category roots, query templates, machine IDs, validation limit and cache settings. The engine applies generic configured stages and never branches on a catalogue name. The editable JSON is stored in <code>catalog-sources.json</code>.</li>
              <li>Downloads are size-limited, cached briefly and checked for ZIP path traversal. A failed source is reported below the usable results instead of cancelling the complete search.</li>

The Hardfile target performs those checks, advances the disc ID and rebuilds its map checksum before download.</div>
            <div class="help-warning"><strong>Do not substitute a descriptor:</strong> GEO geometry belongs to its particular HDA. An HDA without valid matching geometry may be browsed when identifiable, but writing is deliberately blocked to prevent corruption. The HDA ends at the old-format FFS map boundary, as in the official Hardfile Quickstart image; the GEO may describe a slightly larger device. Newly created pairs are checked against that map extent and Hardfile's 256-byte sector, 33-sector track, 16-head and FFS 21-bit size limits before download.</div>

              <h4>Convert a DMS archive back to a disk</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>Open the DMS in any pane. Its tracks are listed with their compression modes and both CRCs; a DMS holds a whole floppy, not a directory.</li>
                <li>Choose <strong>Tools → Convert archive to disk</strong>.</li>
                <li>Select ADF or ADZ as the destination format.</li>
                <li>Every track is written back at the cylinder it came from, so the result is the disk the archive was made from. A track the archive omits, which DiskMasher does for an empty one, is left as zeroes.</li>
                <li>A track this build cannot decompress stops the conversion and says which, rather than producing a disk with a hole in it.</li>
                <li>Choose which other pane receives the rebuilt disk, then browse it like any other volume.</li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <p>Double-click an individual DMS track to open its hex view, or use the download arrow beside its name to export the raw cylinder. A track stored uncompressed can be replaced when its length does not change; save first opens a structural review listing every changed and preserved track. The rebuild changes only the selected payload and its CRCs, and every other track retains its exact bytes. A track that is incomplete, compressed, or whose replacement changes length stays read-only. <strong>Tools → DMS archive project</strong> shows the full track inventory and the reason each one is writable or protected. A DMS stored inside another filing system follows the same rules: detection uses the content, so a file named <code>Games/Thrust</code> opens as a DMS without a <code>.dms</code> suffix, and a gzip-compressed archive works too. Drag the archive onto a hard-drive pane to rebuild the disk and copy its files into a new drawer.</p>

              <p>A script written for a floppy names its files through the drive they came in, as <code>DF0:Game</code>. That reference is correct in a drive and wrong the moment the software is copied to a hard drive, because <code>DF0:</code> is then empty or holds a different disk.</p>

                <li>Atari File Forge starts with the boot script, follows the launch target it names, and checks only those reachable scripts. Unrelated documentation, reviews and game data are not treated as loaders.</li>
                <li>A reference is rewritten only when exactly one file in the volume carries that name. Anything ambiguous is left alone and reported, because a wrong repair is worse than none.</li>
                <li>The replacement is padded with spaces to the length it replaced, so the file's size and every offset after it are unchanged.</li>
                <li>A replacement longer than the reference it replaces is refused, because lengthening the file would move every block after it.</li>
                <li>A persistent image warning names the source image or drawer, affected file, old command and replacement. For example: <code>FastFileSystem compatibility change: Startup-Sequence: DF0:Game &rarr; Games/Game</code>.</li>
                <li>If a reference cannot be resolved to exactly one file, no bytes are changed. Unresolved references from the same script are condensed into one warning for manual testing.</li>

              <ol>
                <li>These releases are not installed the way 3.1 is. The disc carries a Commodore Installer script that runs on the Atari, reads the versions the live system has loaded and patches an existing installation in place. It cannot be run unattended, so Atari File Forge checks what it can and then hands you the machine.</li>
                <li>Choose <strong>Tools &rarr; Install TOS 3.5 or 3.9</strong> with a partition open, then point it at the ISO of the disc you own. Nothing is downloaded.</li>
                <li>The disc is identified by the volume name Commodore wrote, then confirmed by its own drawer, so a contribution CD is not mistaken for a release.</li>
                <li>Both need a 68020 or better. An A1200, A3000, A4000 or CD32 qualifies on its own, as does any machine with a 68020 to 68060 accelerator or a PiStorm. A stock A500 or A600 is told so rather than left to find out from a machine that will not start.</li>
                <li>Both update a system rather than creating one, so a volume with no <code>S:Startup-Sequence</code> has nothing to update. Install Workbench 3.1 onto it first.</li>
                <li>Every blocking reason is shown at once. When they are clear, <strong>Boot with the CD</strong> starts the machine with the drive booting and the disc in the CD drive; open the disc and run its installation icon.</li>
                <li>A stock Workbench 3.1 drive has the CD filing system in <code>L:</code> and the <code>CD0</code> mountlist parked in <code>Storage/DOSDrivers</code>, which GEMDOS does not read, so the machine would boot and show no disc. Booting activates it in <code>Devs/DOSDrivers</code> and points it at the emulated CD drive. That writes to the image, so it takes an undo checkpoint and is reported first.</li>
                <li>Disks are recognised by the volume name inside each image, not by its file name, so a folder of inconsistently named dumps is read correctly and anything that is not part of a release is ignored.</li>
                <li>The release is decided from the Workbench disk and every other disk is matched to it. Mixing releases produces a system whose parts disagree with each other, so a disk from another release is left out rather than installed.</li>
                <li>Workbench and Extras merge into the root; Fonts, Locale, Storage, Classes, Backdrops and Install become drawers of their own. Workbench is copied first, so its full <code>C:</code>, <code>L:</code> and <code>Libs:</code> are not replaced by the cut-down copies the other disks carry.</li>
                <li>Files already on the volume are left alone, so an existing drive is added to rather than replaced, and installing twice does not undo work done in between.</li>
                <li>Change which disc plays each part before installing if the automatic choice is wrong. Only the Workbench disk is required.</li>

            <h3>Raw image hex editor</h3>
            <p class="help-lead">Use the raw editor for deliberate low-level repairs and experiments. It works over the current pane without loading a complete HDD image into the browser.</p>
            <figure><img src="/help/hex-editor.png" alt="Raw image hex editor showing offset, byte, ASCII and value views"><figcaption>The editor overlays only its source pane. Other panes remain visible for reference, while the selected image is protected from other pane actions until the editor closes.</figcaption></figure>
            <div class="help-warning"><strong>Important:</strong> raw edits bypass OFS, FFS, RDB, DMS and container rules. A plausible-looking byte change can destroy a catalogue, free-space map, checksum or disk geometry. Create a named checkpoint first when the current state matters.</div>
            <div class="help-task"><h4>Inspect and navigate raw bytes</h4><ol>
              <li>Open <strong>Tools → Hex editor</strong> in the relevant pane. It is available at a drive&rsquo;s partition table as well as inside normal filesystem views.</li>
              <li>For a paired Hardfile image, choose the HDA or GEO from <strong>Component</strong>. The GEO option edits only the 22-byte geometry descriptor.</li>
              <li>Use first, previous, next and last page, or enter a hexadecimal offset in <strong>Go to offset</strong>. Append <code>d</code> to enter a decimal address.</li>
              <li>Choose a 128, 256, 512 or 1,024-byte page. Only that range is fetched, even for a multi-gigabyte image.</li>
              <li>Select a hex or ASCII cell. The inspector shows unsigned 8, 16 and 32-bit values in little and big-endian order.</li>
              <li>Open <strong>Analyse</strong> to compare the current bytes with a local binary. Differing bytes are marked in the grid, the inspector reports byte and size differences, and <strong>Next difference</strong> navigates through them.</li>
              <li>Select a structure template to decode generic values, an GEMDOS boot or root block, a Rigid Disk Block, a Kickstart ROM header, a resident module tag, a hardfile GEO descriptor or a DMS header and track. Automatic mode recognises safe signatures; a template is an interpretation only and never changes bytes.</li>
            </ol></div>
            <div class="help-task"><h4>Search, select and edit</h4><ol>
              <li>Search for hexadecimal byte pairs such as <code>44 69 73 63</code>, or switch the search to Latin-1 text. Find previous and Find next can wrap around the image. Find and Replace selects the complete matched range and stages a same-length replacement; it cannot insert or remove raw bytes.</li>
              <li>Click a byte, Shift-click another byte, or hold Shift while using the arrow keys to select a range.</li>
              <li>Choose HEX or ASCII mode, then type to replace bytes. You can also paste, fill the selection with one byte, copy as hex or text, or revert selected edits.</li>
              <li>Undo and redo affect staged editor changes only. The staged-change list shows the original and replacement value at every changed offset and can jump back to it.</li>
              <li>Use Ctrl/Cmd-S to write, Ctrl/Cmd-Z or Ctrl/Cmd-Y for undo or redo, Ctrl/Cmd-F to search, Ctrl/Cmd-H for replacement, Ctrl/Cmd-G to go to an offset, and Escape to close.</li>
            </ol></div>
            <div class="help-task"><h4>Write or close safely</h4><ol>
              <li>Select <strong>Write changes</strong>. Read the <strong>This is dangerous. Are you sure?</strong> warning and confirm only if the listed byte count is expected.</li>
              <li>The server rejects the write if another action changed the image after the editor loaded it. It also rejects overlaps, out-of-range writes, resizing and an unconfirmed request.</li>
              <li>An automatic undo checkpoint is created before the fixed-size byte ranges are flushed. Cached partition, directory, dms and export data is cleared so later views cannot reuse stale content.</li>
              <li>Closing with staged bytes offers Keep editing, Discard changes, or Review and write. A protected advanced HFE can be inspected but not written.</li>
              <li>Refresh the pane and run <strong>Analyse → Image health dashboard</strong> after every raw write. Use Edit → Undo last change if the result is not sound.</li>

            <h3>Workbench, analysis and repeatable workflows</h3>
            <p class="help-lead">The Analyse menu in each pane checks the image in context. Workbench in the page header stores reusable settings and portable workspace descriptions.</p>
            <div class="help-task"><h4>Run a complete image health check</h4><ol>
              <li>Open the pane's <strong>Analyse</strong> menu and choose <strong>Image health dashboard</strong>.</li>
              <li>Read the duration warning. Large hard-drive images may take several minutes. The progress view names the current partition and directory and reports elapsed time, throughput and ETA. Abort operation stops at a safe boundary.</li>
              <li>If the host or client is interrupted, reopen the same installation under the same web profile or Linux user. Recover previous session restores owner-isolated working images, while History marks an in-flight server job as interrupted instead of pretending that it completed.</li>
              <li>Review filesystem, geometry, Rigid Disk Block, launcher, STACK, compatibility and hardware-profile findings together. A failed check expands into the individual records behind it, each showing the volume, path, launch command, STACK, exact problem and supporting evidence.</li>
              <li>If a provably safe STACK repair is available, inspect the itemised count and choose <strong>Repair stack sizes</strong>. An automatic checkpoint is made first.</li>
              <li>Run the dashboard again after repairs. A failed launcher check remains manual, because inventing a target would be unsafe.</li>

              <li>Select one or more files or directories.</li>
              <li>Choose <strong>Analyse → Dry-run selected items</strong>.</li>
              <li>Review target-name conversion, truncation and case-insensitive clashes. The dry run does not write the image.</li>
              <li>Bulk HDF-to-FFS imports perform their more detailed capacity, grouping and collision plan in the copy dialog.</li>
            </ol></div>
            <div class="help-task"><h4>Inspect a file or loader</h4><ol>
              <li>Double-click a file in any filesystem pane, or select it and choose <strong>Analyse → Open selected file</strong>. Use the download arrow beside its name when you only want the original file and metadata.</li>
              <li>Open one tokenised ST BASIC or machine-code file and choose <strong>Tools → Find cheat candidates</strong> inside its editor for a read-only report. On a wide editor the report docks on the right at full listing height and scrolls independently; narrow windows place it below the code. Drag the separator, or focus it and use the arrow keys, to resize the two sections. Select a candidate to centre and highlight its BASIC line or decoded address. BASIC requires corroboration between semantic state, plausible initialisation, updates, terminal tests and gameplay outcomes. Machine code joins initialisation, access to the same storage, updates, forward terminal branches and saved labels across 68000, 68010, 68020, ARM and 68000. Reachable unlabelled state changes with a forward decision are retained as Possible; speculative instructions decoded from embedded data are excluded. Unexplained writes, opaque countdowns, backward decrement loops, hardware registers and likely copy, clear, scan or delay counters are suppressed. Loader commands and packed or runtime-generated payloads are identified explicitly when static analysis cannot reach the final game code. Trainer-style NOP, RTS, JMP and BIT writes remain separately identified with a warning. Filter by likely purpose or confidence. Online title evidence and configured specialist searches are optional and never prove that similarly named bytes match. For a selected machine-code result with an exact offset, <strong>Prepare guarded patch</strong> records the complete source hash, guarded bytes, hardware profile, two tester-supplied emulator observations, rationale, author and rollback instructions. Apply verifies the hash and bytes again and creates an automatic checkpoint. The host-private library matches exact files, never titles. Automatic watchpoint correlation is not claimed.</li>
              <li>Tokenised ST BASIC 1.0 opens as numbered editable source with a space after every line number. Use <strong>Tools → Renumber BASIC</strong> to update line numbers and encoded GOTO, GOSUB and other references without changing numbers inside strings.</li>
              <li>When pasting into BASIC, choose whether to validate and normalise numbered ST BASIC source or insert the clipboard exactly as plain text. The complete listing must be valid BASIC before Save can retokenise it.</li>
              <li><code>Startup-Sequence</code>, <code>Loader</code> and other recognised scripts open as compact unnumbered script editors. Edit their ordered GEMDOS command lines directly.</li>
              <li>Source and disassembly windows open centred at a useful desktop working size, then scale proportionally on smaller browser windows. They can be moved by dragging the title bar and resized from any edge or corner. Use the square title-bar control, or double-click the title bar, to maximise and restore the editor. The window remains constrained to the visible browser area and resizing does not disturb the document or its scroll position. File and Edit menus provide Save, Save As, Export, Close, undo, redo, clipboard actions, Select All, Find and Find and Replace. Replace Next starts at the current selection and wraps once; Replace All reports how many case-insensitive matches it changed. Save As creates a sibling inside the image while Export downloads readable source as browser-local text. Read-only disassembly retains Find without unsafe source replacement.</li>
              <li>The tab strip keeps several files from the mounted image open together. It retains each source draft, selection and scroll position, marks dirty tabs and warns before discarding one. <strong>Open from image…</strong> searches filenames and bounded readable content, restores the result's partition and directory, and opens it as another tab.</li>
              <li>BASIC and command scripts use themed syntax colours for keywords, strings, numbers, comments, symbols and line numbers. The normal textarea remains the editable document, preserving browser undo, clipboard and input-method behaviour. Hover a highlighted command for its purpose, syntax, requirements and important compatibility notes. One catalogue covers ST BASIC 1.0 plus the extra statements ST BASIC 1.2 added, with availability checked against the detected dialect. A word glued to a name, such as <code>printer</code> or <code>total</code>, stays a variable, because that is what the interpreter's own tokeniser does with it.</li>
              <li>An GEMDOS script and an ST BASIC program are told apart by vocabulary, because GEMDOS names its commands without any sigil. <code>LOAD "Program"</code> in a BASIC line shows ST BASIC LOAD help, while <code>Execute Loader</code> in a script shows the GEMDOS command's syntax. RUN and other overlapping names follow the same rule.</li>
              <li>Help interprets command names and constant operands. <code>POKEW &amp;HDFF180,0</code> names <code>COLOR00</code> and says the write goes straight to the hardware; an odd address for a word or long write is reported, because a 68000 cannot make one. <code>SCREEN</code> explains what a depth costs in Chip RAM and warns when a mode interlaces. <code>LIBRARY</code> names the <code>.bmap</code> file the call needs. SOUND, WAVE, SAY and PALETTE show every proven argument. The result is compared with the hardware profile applied to the pane, and a call documented for a different chipset is explained and then marked as out of scope. Dynamic expressions remain unguessed.</li>
              <li>Assembly source decodes proven constant calls. A <code>JSR</code> through a negative offset from A6 is named as the library function it calls, using the immediate loads earlier on the same line for its parameters. <code>MOVEA.L $4,A6</code> is recognised as reading ExecBase, and an absolute operand that names a custom-chip register is labelled.</li>
              <li>Hover a 68000 mnemonic, a library vector symbol such as <code>_LVOOpenLibrary</code>, an absolute address such as <code>$DFF180</code>, or a directive such as <code>DC.B</code>. The processor catalogue keeps the 68000, 68010, 68020, 68030, 68040 and 68060 instruction sets distinct rather than treating every extension as interchangeable, so an instruction a machine cannot run is not offered as if it could.</li>
              <li>Press <strong>F1</strong> for help on the command at the caret. The editor's <strong>Help</strong> menu gives an overview of the detected language, a searchable command reference, live problems and document symbols. Problem and symbol entries jump back to their source location.</li>
              <li><strong>Edit → Find all references</strong> lists code uses of the symbol at the caret. <strong>Rename symbol</strong> changes those uses as one undoable operation while leaving strings and comments alone. The BASIC program outline lists subprograms and functions with their call sites. Diagnostics also flag unused definitions, mismatched SUB endings and conservative unreachable-line candidates.</li>
              <li><strong>Find and Replace</strong> stays open while you work and supports match case, whole identifiers, regular expressions, selection-only scope, previous/next, one replacement, preview and Replace All. <strong>Search files in this image</strong> finds names and bounded readable content across the mounted filesystem, then opens the containing location. <strong>Analyse file dependencies</strong> checks the entire image and reports exact, unique, ambiguous, missing and root-relative launcher targets.</li>
              <li>Press <strong>Ctrl+Space</strong> for completions from known commands, identifiers, document symbols and templates. Text and script files provide duplicate, move, join and delete line operations. BASIC disables line moves that cannot preserve line-number meaning. <strong>Format selection or file</strong> applies conservative whitespace rules; BASIC must pass a token round trip before the proposal is applied.</li>
              <li>Refactor and Condense show the original and proposed source side by side. Changed rows are marked. Every BASIC proposal completes an exact tokenise, detokenise and retokenise check before acceptance; the review displays its line count and tokenised byte size. Use <strong>Tools → Verify BASIC round trip</strong> to run the check independently, and <strong>Editor history</strong> to review accepted transformations and symbol renames from this window.</li>
              <li><strong>View → Show synchronized bytes</strong> follows the BASIC line, text caret or selected disassembly row. It shows the matching saved bytes and printable characters, with a shortcut into the full Hex editor. Unsaved source is never presented as if it had already changed the image. A new or renumbered BASIC line reports that it has no saved byte range until Save succeeds.</li>
              <li>Live BASIC checks cover missing, duplicate and out-of-order line numbers, unresolved direct GOTO, GOSUB and RESTORE destinations, a CALL with no matching SUB, a SUB with no END SUB, and unclosed strings. Script checks cover unclosed strings and floppy-device references that will not resolve once the software is on a hard drive. Treat these as focused editing checks rather than proof that software will run on every target.</li>
              <li>Use <strong>Edit → Go to line</strong> for a physical source line or BASIC line number. BASIC selections can be commented or uncommented with <strong>Toggle comment</strong>. <strong>Tools → Normalise recognised commands</strong> follows the detected language convention while leaving strings, comments and identifiers unchanged. ST BASIC normalises its keywords to uppercase, and GEMDOS scripts to the mixed case the commands are named in; the mechanism can support lowercase-preferring languages.</li>
              <li><strong>Tools → Refactor selection or program</strong> applies to one selected line, a selected block, or the complete program when nothing is selected. It opens a non-destructive proposal that normalises proven BASIC commands, expands every safe colon-separated operation, and turns nested IF/ELSE IF/ELSE forms into readable guarded branches without changing their scope. It renumbers from 10 and updates direct destinations, including every entry in ON GOTO and ON GOSUB lists. Omitted-THEN command and assignment branches are recognised when the statement boundary can be proved. A compact ON ERROR handler is extracted behind an explicit ON ERROR GOTO target and a normal-flow jump over the handler. A line that is one GEMDOS command remains a physical unit, because the rest of it is command text. Nothing changes until ✓ is selected and confirmed; × discards the proposal untouched. The accepted rewrite is one undoable operation and retains the logical cursor and viewport.</li>
              <li><strong>Tools → Condense selection or program</strong> is the safe inverse. It uses colons to pack adjacent statements into the fewest tokenised lines allowed by the real ST BASIC line limit. Explicit target lines begin a new packed line. Inline IF scope, ON ERROR handlers, comments, unconditional transfers and structured branch boundaries are never crossed. Programs with computed line destinations or ERL-dependent behaviour are refused rather than guessed. Surviving line numbers are retained. Condense also uses the ✓/× proposal, one-step undo and viewport preservation.</li>
              <li>BASIC subprograms, FOR and WHILE loops and structured IF and SELECT CASE blocks have minus controls in the left gutter. Select one to collapse that block and use its plus control to restore it. The single View command reads <strong>Collapse all blocks</strong> when everything is expanded and <strong>Expand all blocks</strong> when anything is collapsed. Folding never changes the real textarea or saved program. Double-click an outline line to expand everything and continue editing there. Every file initially opens fully expanded.</li>
              <li><strong>View → Structure guidance</strong> draws live 2, 4, or 8-character guide steps beside the editable BASIC source and highlights the innermost procedure, function, loop or structured conditional containing the caret. It is presentation only and never inserts indentation, replaces the textarea, changes dirty state or alters saved image bytes.</li>
              <li>Subprograms and multi-line functions receive consistent guide levels from <code>SUB name</code> or <code>DEF FNname</code> to <code>END SUB</code> or the function's leading <code>=</code> return. Closers later on a line, such as <code>NEXT:END SUB</code>, are recognised. A one-line <code>DEF FNname(...)=expression</code> does not open a block. Folding uses the same scanner.</li>
              <li>Structure guidance classifies Refactor's generated lines immediately using the same scanner as folding. A classic <code>IF condition THEN line</code> controls one statement and does not open a multi-line block, so later physical lines reached through branching or fall-through are not shown inside it. The saved program remains free of display-only indentation.</li>
              <li>Other readable files open in the text editor. Binary files open as editor-style 68000-family source. Proven register values, library call purposes, branch conditions, custom-chip and CIA register accesses, entry points and cross-references appear as semicolon comments on the relevant instruction. Internal targets receive stable labels derived from proved behaviour, such as <code>write_text_8120</code>, <code>open_close_file_834A</code>, <code>loop_8057</code> or <code>equal_80C2</code>, instead of anonymous subroutine/location names. The hexadecimal suffix keeps similar routines distinct. The analyser drops register assumptions at uncertain control-flow joins instead of inventing values. The readable-string list filters out accidental punctuation and number runs; select a string to jump to its disassembled line. Double-click an instruction only when you want that offset in Hex.</li>
              <li>Every disassembly row has hover help, including condition and size variants, unfamiliar decoder mnemonics and pseudo-operations such as <code>DC.B</code> and <code>DC.W</code>. Help combines the operation family, exact operand and addressing form, encoded bytes, cross-references and the analyser's contextual comment. Library vectors retain their specific register conventions. The Help menu lists operations actually present as well as its instruction and library reference.</li>
              <li>The disassembly <strong>Project</strong> menu retains notes, bookmarks, symbols, offset-bound comments and code/data decisions outside the image bytes. Click one row or shift-click a range, then mark it as code, text, bytes, words, addresses or bitmap data. The listing is rebuilt using that decision. Every word and long region uses big-endian values, because every 68000-family processor reads them that way. Symbols apply to every supported processor and use a portable <code>&amp;address = label</code> text format for import and export. Find references and the outline show direct callers and labelled entry points.</li>
              <li><strong>Tools → Inspect selected data</strong> presents bounded text, bytes, little-endian and big-endian words, plus a one-bit bitmap preview. Project metadata has one manager for notes, symbols, comments, bookmarks and portable JSON. A saved line comment remains attached to its exact file offset and is rendered beside the instruction. <strong>Compare with saved file</strong> displays saved and current source side by side.</li>
              <li><strong>Edit and reassemble</strong> is enabled only when <code>ATARI_FILE_ASSEMBLER_COMMAND</code> contains <code>{source}</code> and <code>{output}</code>. It opens generated label-oriented assembly for review and requires confirmation before checksum-guarded replacement of the complete binary. <strong>Debug from selected address</strong> uses a configured <code>ATARI_FILE_DEBUGGER_COMMAND</code>; the return status and output are retained in project history.</li>
              <li><strong>Tools → Run… / Debug…</strong> appears in every pane whose media can be attached to the configured machine. Floppy images and DMS archives mount directly in a drive. A hard drive is attached whole, from its partition table, with a profile that declares a mass-storage interface: the app copies the working <code>.hdf</code> to a private file and attaches that, so the image you are editing is isolated from emulator writes.</li>
              <li><strong>Project → Run in configured emulator</strong> appears in source and disassembly editors. Choose a hardware profile in the Workbench and apply it to the pane. Every machine from an Atari 500 to a 4000 or CD32 runs under the bundled FS-UAE build, which is the one managed emulator. BASIC offers Inject and run/debug BASIC buffer, Mount and boot parent, or Mount parent only. Injection tokenises the current editor text into a temporary bootable floppy as <code>PROGRAM</code>, so unsaved changes are included but companion files are not. Parent choices retain dependencies and appear only if that emulator supports the container. The running machine appears in a live browser display. Click the display before typing, use Full screen when useful, and choose Stop and close to end the emulator cleanly. Capability and error text always names the effective pane emulator. <strong>Emulator and debugger results</strong> retains return status and output. Errors and notices raised while an editor is open are displayed inside that editor window, above its content, so they cannot be hidden behind the modal backdrop.</li>
              <li>Editor tabs, unsaved drafts, selection and scroll position survive a refresh in bounded browser-session storage. <strong>Open from image…</strong> searches every partition of a hard drive and labels results with its device name and volume title.</li>
              <li>The Hex editor includes structured views for ROM, Kickstart ROM, TOS modules, OFS, FFS, the Rigid Disk Block, Hardfile GEO and DMS data. A custom JSON template can describe bounded fields relative to the selected byte.</li>
              <li>Labelled disassembly regions also have left-gutter folding controls. The single state-aware <strong>View</strong> command collapses or expands all labelled regions as appropriate. Visible instruction rows retain double-click-to-Hex while other regions are folded.</li>
              <li>ZIP, TAR, compressed TAR, GZIP, BZIP2 and XZ files are marked as archives. Double-click one to browse its safe file and folder hierarchy in the pane; use breadcrumbs or <strong>..</strong> to move up. Double-click a member to extract it in memory and open the normal BASIC, command-script, text, disassembly or hex viewer. Readable members can be edited: Save verifies both hashes, rebuilds the complete container and checkpoints the outer image. A DMS member additionally needs a complete one-to-one standard-block reconstruction and an unchanged encoded length; its before-save view proves that all timing and control chunks are retained. Parent traversal, non-regular TAR objects, archives over 512 MiB, members over 128 MiB and catalogues reaching 20,000 entries are rejected rather than processed without a safe bound.</li>
              <li>Use <strong>Tools → Open raw bytes in Hex</strong> from any file viewer when the automatic interpretation is uncertain. File saves retain Atari load, execution and filetype metadata, reject stale edits and create an undo checkpoint.</li>
              <li>The shared structural scanner understands ST BASIC's block forms and its typed variables, and carries explicit ST BASIC 1.0 and 1.2 capability profiles. Diagnostics flag statements that need the later release. ST BASIC 1.0 programs with a recognised trailing payload are editable because only the tokenised prefix is replaced and the payload is preserved byte for byte. ST BASIC 1.2 remains read-only because rewriting its extended tokens as ST BASIC 1.0 would be unsafe.</li>
              <li>Choose <strong>Check loader dependencies</strong> to resolve CHAIN, Execute, Run, LOAD and CD targets beside the launcher, and to flag volume-rooted references before software is moved below the volume root.</li>

Add an open image with an optional SD-card label, NAS path or physical location and its target machines. The web edition stores complete manifests and hashes in origin-scoped IndexedDB.

              <li>Choose <strong>Search</strong> in the application header to search every distinct open image with one query. It matches filenames, protection bits, comments, datestamps, Workbench icon types, bounded BASIC or script text, useful printable strings in binary files and raw ROM banks, recognised volume titles, publishers, launch actions and stack sizes, and ROM Workbench symbols, regions, notes and comments. An 8 to 64 digit SHA-256 prefix finds exact file content and displays the complete digest. Results identify their pane, image, path or ROM bank. Selecting one restores and raises its pane, navigates to the containing location and opens the file or relevant ROM Workbench address.</li>
              <li><strong>Analyse → Find duplicates / variants</strong> groups byte-identical content by SHA-256 and likely variants by normalised volume or path name. It compares drawer names, catalogued file content and whole volumes, so the same game installed under two different names is still found.</li>
              <li>Duplicate records are listed by title, volume and path. Select records directly using the checkbox on each result row. Equivalent groups compare filenames, protection bits, comments, sizes and SHA-256 file hashes. Whole-volume matches remain available as the strongest disk-level check.</li>
              <li>A compilation receives an extra warning listing the other titles it holds, so deleting it is a deliberate choice rather than an accident.</li>
              <li><strong>Export collection manifest</strong> downloads CSV or JSON containing partitions, files, Atari metadata and checksums.</li>
              <li><strong>Compare with open image</strong> matches two manifests by filesystem path, partition or ROM bank. It separates additions, removals, proven renames or moves, changed bytes and metadata-only edits, then joins changed raw-byte ranges for the primary image and companion descriptor. A rename is reported only when content, size and filesystem context identify one unique pair; ambiguous duplicate files remain separate additions and removals. Export JSON retains the deterministic logical fingerprints and full itemised evidence. Different filesystem families can be compared as inventories but are marked unsuitable for direct patching.</li>
              <li>For matching filesystem families, partition layouts and ROM bank sizes, <strong>Download patch</strong> creates an <code>.affpatch.zip</code> containing the reviewed operation plan and only changed payloads. Tick changes to export a selective patch or leave every box clear for the complete comparison. Selective patches derive their own final fingerprint and automatically include the parent-drawer dependencies they need. Comparison, archive creation and verification show the current catalogue, checksum or payload phase with byte or item counts, elapsed time, throughput and ETA where meaningful. Abort stops these read-only stages safely without changing either image. <strong>Analyse → Apply guarded patch</strong> first performs a read-only preflight against the exact base fingerprint and verifies every payload. It shows the base and candidate names, change totals and an itemised operation preview; Apply remains disabled until verification succeeds. Applying creates an automatic checkpoint, repeats validation before writing and checks the complete candidate fingerprint afterwards. Abort during application restores that checkpoint. Stale, corrupt and wrong-format patches are rejected and failed applications roll back.</li>
              <li><strong>Analyse → Dry-run selected items</strong> creates a versioned compatibility report without writing. Each row records its proposed target name, Atari metadata and any filename, directory or TOS filetype conversion or loss. Export the result as JSON or Markdown. A report without blocking findings can be kept with the working image; the next saved ZIP includes its canonical JSON and Markdown below <code>Compatibility/</code>. Cross-format drag, clipboard, File-menu and Online Library batches now show this shared report before their first destination write.</li>

            <div class="help-task"><h4>Profiles, recipes and projects</h4><ol>
              <li>Choose <strong>Workbench → Hardware profiles</strong>. Start from a stock Atari 500, 500+, 600, 1200, 2000, 3000, 4000 or CD32 profile, a common disk or mass-storage configuration, or the supplied hardfile custom system.</li>
              <li>Select the base machine in the left column, then build its hardware in the wider right column. Kickstart, floppy interface, memory and accelerator choices use dropdowns because only one can be fitted. A PiStorm replaces the CPU, so it cannot be combined with another accelerator. Cumulative firmware, mass-storage and expansion-card groups use bounded checkboxes. The list changes with the machine, required carrier or bus expansions are added automatically, and removing a dependency clears combinations that can no longer exist.</li>
              <li>A profile also records the Library filter, filing system, FastFileSystem build, expected stack size, validation target, managed emulator, debugger, RAM and startup action. Emulator-driven additions select the closest FS-UAE configuration, processor and controller. Hardware marked <strong>Validation only</strong> still affects analysis without pretending that the emulator implements it.</li>
              <li>Save retains the profile in this host's private state. Apply attaches it to an image session. The active profile becomes the default for panes without their own profile and drives Online Library machine filtering.</li>
              <li>Choose <strong>Import recipes</strong> to save naming, group prefix, online metadata and compatibility choices. Saved recipes appear in the import planner.</li>
              <li>Choose <strong>Portable project</strong> to export the current pane windows, their geometry and stack, session references, paths, profiles and recipes. Import it on the same retained installation to restore that working context. Theme remains a local host preference.</li>
              <li>In the same screen, choose an open image and select <strong>Export workflow bundle</strong> for a deterministic rebuild package. It records the earliest retained pre-change image and GEO hashes, a guarded patch for every subsequent filesystem change, the active hardware and accepted compatibility decisions, and the exact expected output hashes. The original image bytes are not included. Extract the ZIP and follow its README; <code>recipe-run</code> refuses a changed base, descriptor, patch or rebuilt result. Edited legacy sessions without a retained base, DMS archives and HFE track containers are rejected rather than represented as safely reproducible.</li>
            </ol></div>
            <div class="help-task"><h4>Monitor, abort and resume jobs</h4><ol>
              <li>Choose <strong>Jobs</strong> in the header. Running, paused, failed, completed and interrupted work remains visible after its foreground dialog closes.</li>
              <li>Abort requests stop at the next safe filesystem boundary.</li>
              <li>Resumable bulk jobs retain their request, completed items and skipped items. Choose <strong>Resume</strong> to submit only the remaining items.</li>

            <h3>Compatibility, limits and troubleshooting</h3>
            <h4>Important compatibility limits</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>The bundled Atarinut engine creates and edits every writable GEMDOS DOS type (OFS, FFS and their international and directory-cache variants) on floppies, RDB hard drives and a bare Hardfile HDA with its matching GEO.</li>
              <li>An GEMDOS name is up to 30 characters and may not contain a colon or a slash; a full stop is an ordinary character. A directory has no fixed entry limit: its 72-entry hash table chains collisions, so a drawer holds as many files as the volume has free blocks. The pane and bulk planner use those detected limits.</li>
              <li>A hard-drive image whose volume begins at an emulator's own header offset is content-detected and retains that layout.</li>
              <li>“Physical HDD” means a byte-for-byte RAW image. The browser and container do not access devices such as <code>/dev/sdb</code> directly.</li>
              <li>A DMS track is editable only under the archive project's same-length structural proof. Convert the archive back to a disk for unrestricted filesystem editing.</li>
              <li>HFE v2/v3, bad-sector and advanced track images open read-only. Clean sector-based HFE v1 images can be edited and are verified again when saved.</li>
              <li>Metadata is preserved only where the destination filing system has an equivalent field.</li>
            </ul>

              <dt>Invalid filename</dt><dd>Use the prompted replacement. An GEMDOS file, drawer or volume name allows up to 30 Latin-1 characters and excludes the colon and both slashes; a partition device name allows up to 31 and Kickstart ROM leaves up to 30. Leading or trailing whitespace, path syntax and control characters are rejected. The compatibility review normalises and truncates before writing, then checks case-insensitive clashes within each destination directory.</dd>
              <dt>Not enough space</dt><dd>Delete unwanted data, compact the filesystem, or create a larger destination. OFS keeps 24 bytes of header in every data block, so it stores 488 bytes per block against the full 512 bytes FFS uses and fits noticeably less on the same disk.</dd>
              <dt>A high-density disk will not open on this machine</dt><dd>The 1760 KiB format is written only by the HD drives of the A3000 and A4000. Every other Atari reads DS/DD, so a target set to an A500, A600 or A1200 refuses a high-density image rather than offering a disk that machine could never read.</dd>
              <dt>HFE is read-only</dt><dd>The image uses HFE v2/v3, reports bad sectors, or contains track features the sector editor cannot reproduce safely. Export its files or copy its readable sectors to another image.</dd>
              <dt>HxCFE is reported missing</dt><dd>Official Docker images and native 0.0.0 packages include HxCFE and its supporting libraries.

              <dt>An GEMDOS image cannot be opened</dt><dd>Confirm it is a raw GEMDOS image or a supported HDF layout rather than a compressed archive or a flux capture. The detailed error distinguishes an unrecognised filesystem from a corrupt map or directory.</dd>

              <dt>HDA geometry error</dt><dd>A bare Hardfile HDA needs its exact matching GEO file, because surfaces, blocks per track and cylinders are recorded there rather than in the image. An image carrying a Rigid Disk Block describes its own geometry and needs no sidecar.</dd>

              <li>The repository and its source archives do not include the local <code>samples/</code> directory. Developers can place their own test images there without adding them to Git, <code>git archive</code> output or the Docker build context.</li>
