"""Geometry for an RDB-less hardfile, and the checks a real machine applies.

A ``.hdf`` that carries a Rigid Disk Block describes itself. A *hardfile* does
not: it is a bare volume, and the host has to be told how many surfaces and
sectors to pretend it has before GEMDOS will mount it. Emulators keep that
in a ``.geo`` sidecar of ``key=value`` lines, and Atari File Forge reads and
writes the same file so an image prepared for FS-UAE opens here without being
described twice.

Everything here is a pure function of bytes on disk. Nothing in this module
opens a session, so the geometry rules can be tested without the workbench.
