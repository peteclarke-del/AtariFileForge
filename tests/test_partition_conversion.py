"""Converting a hard drive between its two shapes.

An Atari hard drive exists in one of two forms, and both are called ``.hdf``.
One carries a Rigid Disk Block and describes its own geometry; the other is a
bare hardfile that holds a single volume and nothing else, so the host has to
be told the geometry separately. Software in the wild uses both, and these
tests cover converting either way without losing the volume.
