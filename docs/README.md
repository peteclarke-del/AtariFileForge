# Atari File Forge documentation

This directory is the technical handbook for Atari File Forge. Start with the
task you need to complete, then follow the linked guide for the details. The
in-app **Help** handbook covers the same workflows with controls and terminology
that match the running frontend.

The table is a navigation aid, not a replacement for format restrictions.
Atari File Forge rejects geometry, track and filesystem variants it cannot
write safely. Read the warning shown by the application before converting or
repairing unusual media.

## Main workflows

### Work with several images

The workspace starts with one pane and has no fixed pane-count limit. Each pane
is a movable, resizable window with its own open image, current directory,
selection, progress, undo history and hardware profile. Panes can overlap,
snap to workspace sides or corners, minimise to the workspace shelf and restore
their layout after refresh. Dragging between panes
uses the same validation as Cut, Copy and Paste, including the 30-character
GEMDOS name limit, free-block capacity and metadata conversion.

Cross-format drag, clipboard, File-menu and Online Library batches stop at a
shared compatibility review before the first write. The review records every
target-name conversion and metadata loss using the same exportable schema as
**Analyse → Dry-run selected items**.

### Edit files by content

Double-click a file to open the suitable editor. Tokenised ST BASIC opens as
editable source, command files open as scripts, recognised machine code opens
as annotated disassembly, archives open as file hierarchies, and other binary
data opens in the hex editor. The editor includes search and replace, history,
safe save and save-as operations, local export, folding, language help, BASIC
formatting and guarded source transformations. See the
[editor handbook](FILE-EDITOR-GUIDE.md) for the exact save and byte-sync rules.

Open one BASIC or machine-code file and use **Tools → Find cheat candidates**
for a read-only gameplay-state report. It distinguishes strong,
likely and possible evidence, supports purpose filters and links to optional
online identification and specialist references. It does not patch uncertain
code. Proven machine-code changes can be saved as exact-hash guarded patches;
the host-private library matches the complete file hash and original bytes,
then applies through an automatic checkpoint. Runtime observations remain
tester supplied until managed watchpoint correlation is complete. See the
[cheat analysis guide](CHEAT-ANALYSIS-GUIDE.md).

### Identify what a disk is and how it starts

An imported disk arrives with a volume name, a set of files and nothing else.
Atari File Forge reads that evidence and proposes a title, the file that starts
the software, and the stack that file needs. `DiskMenu` outranks the
`Startup-Sequence`, because it is what the disk's own author wrote to be run;
conventional loader names follow, judged by their actual content rather than
their name alone. Every proposal carries its evidence, and one the evidence
does not support is marked ambiguous so the caller asks rather than writes.

### Test against a hardware profile

The Workbench describes the base machine, filing system, compatible additions,
accelerator state, memory and FastFileSystem ROM build. Analysis and help use
that profile when deciding whether a command, loader or image is appropriate.
A managed FS-UAE session provides launch and debugging paths for every medium
it can genuinely mount; it is the one bundled emulator because a single
portable build covers the whole Atari range.

![Hardware profile and emulator configuration](images/hardware-workbench-current.png)

Use **Tools → Build hardware deployment** to create a validated Gotek,
whole-drive, Hardfile, PiStorm or TOS directory tree from the open image. The assistant
works on an isolated snapshot, shows exact paths and SHA-256 values, and writes
the installation, verification and rollback procedure into the downloaded
ZIP. See the [deployment guide](HARDWARE-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md).

### Preserve and recover work

Browser-owned sessions are private working copies. Named checkpoints and undo
cover image changes, while workspace restoration reopens panes after an
ordinary refresh. Saving builds a timestamped ZIP only after the image and its
documentation are complete. Each package includes the image, partner and
metadata files where applicable, checksums, target details, warnings and a
generated README.

### Automate a repeatable build

The supported headless CLI exposes image creation, finalisation, validation,
manifest export, host-file import, DMS conversion, compaction, comparison and
guarded patches. Mutating commands have a dry-run
mode with stable JSON status and exit codes. Completed commands can record a
versioned recipe containing exact source hashes and replayable non-secret
decisions. See the [CLI guide](CLI-GUIDE.md).

### Catalogue a collection

The header **Collection** command indexes complete manifests in private local
state. The web edition uses origin-scoped IndexedDB; the Linux desktop edition
uses an atomic, mode-0600 XDG configuration file. It records user-supplied
locations and machines, identifies exact
cross-image content and title variants, maintains a wanted-title list and marks
entries stale when an open image revision changes. Full database backup/import
and a smaller report export remain separate. See the
[collection guide](COLLECTION-GUIDE.md).

## Documentation conventions

- Write direct, factual prose. State the supported operation, its validation
  boundary and the observable failure mode. Do not imply support that has not
  been exercised.
- Use commas, colons, semicolons or separate sentences instead of em dashes.
- Distinguish implemented behaviour, retained test evidence and work that
  still requires hardware or architecture-specific validation.
- Menu paths use **File → Save image** style notation.
- Atari paths use their native syntax: `/` between components and a bare `:`
  for the volume root, as in `Games/Chuckulus` or `S/Startup-Sequence`. A full
  stop is an ordinary character in a name, never a separator.
- Sizes use KiB, MiB and GiB when describing byte capacity.
- “Working image” means the private server-side copy, not the source selected
  from the local computer.
- “Save” updates the working image. “Export” downloads an individual file.
  “Save image” creates the timestamped download package.
- Screenshots are captured from the current Docker build and should be updated
  whenever the illustrated controls or workflow change materially.

## Keeping the handbook current

Documentation changes are part of feature work. A change is complete when:

1. The main README and the relevant specialist guide describe the behaviour.
2. The in-app handbook uses the same names and restrictions.
3. Configuration, environment variables, ports and persistence rules match the
   Docker files in the repository.
4. Local links and image references resolve.
5. Changed UI screenshots are captured from a clean current build.
6. The release checklist includes any new generated-media or manual test gate.
7. Documentation regression tests pass and the published prose contains no em
   dashes or obsolete pane-count claims.

Do not use files from `samples/` as published documentation assets. That
directory is intentionally excluded from Git, release archives and the Docker
build context.
