# IPF captures and the SPS decoder library

An IPF is a preservation image made by the Software Preservation Society. It
records what was physically on the disk: the bit cells, their timing, and the
deliberate irregularities that copy protection depends on. That is why a
protected Atari disk survives as an IPF and not as an ADF, and why an IPF is
worth keeping even after you have extracted the files from it.

Atari File Forge can open an IPF and read the ordinary GEMDOS sectors out of
it. It cannot invent an ADF that holds the parts an ADF has no way to express;
where a track is not a standard GEMDOS track, the workbench says so rather
than filling the gap.

## Why the library is not included

Decoding an IPF needs the SPS decoder library, usually built as
`libcapsimage`. Its licence permits use and non-commercial redistribution but
not sale or inclusion in a commercial product, so Atari File Forge does not
ship it. Instead it looks for the library when you open an IPF, and tells you
plainly when it is not there.

Nothing else in the application depends on it. Every other format is handled
in-tree.

## Installing it

Build it once and put it where the workbench looks:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/FrodeSolheim/capsimg.git
cd capsimg
./bootstrap          # needs autoconf and autoheader
./configure
make

mkdir -p ~/.config/atari-file-forge/lib
cp CAPSImg/libcapsimage.so.5.1 ~/.config/atari-file-forge/lib/
ln -sf libcapsimage.so.5.1 ~/.config/atari-file-forge/lib/libcapsimage.so.5
ln -sf libcapsimage.so.5.1 ~/.config/atari-file-forge/lib/libcapsimage.so
```

The workbench searches these places, in order:

1. the file named by `ATARI_FILE_FORGE_CAPSIMAGE`, if that variable is set;
2. `~/.config/atari-file-forge/lib`;
3. `/opt/atari-file-forge/native/lib`, where the packaged builds put it;
4. `/usr/local/lib` and `/usr/lib`.

Point the environment variable at one exact file when you want to test a
particular build:

```bash
ATARI_FILE_FORGE_CAPSIMAGE=/path/to/libcapsimage.so.5.1 python -m app.cli identify capture.ipf
```

On Windows the library is `CAPSImg.dll` and on macOS `libcapsimage.dylib`; the
same search order applies.

## What opening an IPF does

1. The library decodes the capture into each track's MFM bit cells.
2. Atari File Forge finds every sector's sync mark in those cells, splits the
   odd and even bit planes the format interleaves, and checks the header and
   data checksums.
3. A sector that passes both checks is written into a working ADF. One that
   fails is reported and its place left as zeroes.
4. The pane opens on the working image, and the original capture is left
   untouched beside it.

The pane's warnings say how many of the expected sectors were recovered. A
capture of an unprotected disk normally recovers all of them; a protected one
often does not, and the difference is the protection itself.

## What it does not do

- It does not write IPF. The format is a preservation record of a physical
  read; the workbench has nothing to preserve a reading of.
- It does not reproduce weak bits, long tracks or non-standard sector layouts
  in the working image. Those survive only in the capture.
- It does not fall back to guessing. If no standard sector is recovered, the
  open is refused with the reason rather than handing you an empty disk.

## When the library is missing

Opening an IPF then fails with a message naming the library, the directory to
put it in, and the environment variable that overrides the search. Nothing
else changes: the rest of the application works exactly as it does with the
library installed.
