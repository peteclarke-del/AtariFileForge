# Preparing a hard drive and installing floppies onto it

Copying a game disk into an HDF gives you the files. It does not give you
something that runs. The title still expects to be booted from `DF0:`, and the
hard drive still has no idea it is there. This guide covers the ways Atari File
Forge closes that gap, and it is honest about what each one can and cannot do.

It starts with the drive itself. A blank partition is not a machine you can
use, so the first section covers installing TOS onto it from your own
Workbench floppies. The rest covers getting a title onto the drive once there
is a system there to run it.

The choice appears in the import dialog whenever the pane you are dropping onto
is a mounted GEMDOS volume on a hard drive. Under **Import as** you get:

* Copy the disc contents in as they are, which is the behaviour that has always
  been there.
* Install it onto this drive, which is what this guide is about.
* Store the original image as an ordinary file, when the disc image itself is
  what you want to keep.

A floppy pane offers no install option, because a floppy has nowhere to install
to. A drive showing its partition table offers none either: a partition table is
not a volume. Enter a partition first.

## Preparing the drive: install Workbench

Choose **Tools -> Install Workbench** with a partition open, then point at the
folder holding your Workbench floppy images, or pick the images yourself.

No TOS is shipped with Atari File Forge and none is downloaded. It is not
free to redistribute, so the disks have to be the ones you own. ADF, ADZ, DMS
and HFE images are all read, including the zipped-per-disk form a TOSEC
collection uses.

Pointing at a whole collection folder is fine. A TOSEC `Workbench` folder holds
every release together, and everything in it that is not part of one is listed
as ignored. The disks you did not choose are simply not installed.

**Disks are recognised by the volume name inside each image, not by its file
name.** ADF collections are named inconsistently - `wb31_workbench.adf`,
`Workbench 3.1 (Disk 2 of 6).adf`, `disk02.adf` - and a renamed file says
nothing at all about its contents, while the volume name was written by
Commodore and travels with the data. That is what lets you point at a folder
rather than assembling the set by hand; anything in it that is not part of a
release is listed as ignored rather than silently included.

**The release is decided once, from the Workbench disk, and every other disk is
matched to it.** Mixing releases is the classic way to end up with a drive that
looks complete and boots to a Guru: a 2.0 Extras drawer on a 3.1 system, or a
Locale disk from a release that had none, produces a system whose parts disagree
about what the others provide. A disk from another release is left out rather
than mixed in. Where a collection holds several dumps of the same disk, one that
says it was verified is preferred and one that says it was modified or cracked
is avoided.

Each disk lands where the TOS install script would put it:

| Disk | Lands in | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workbench | volume root | Required. The system itself: `C`, `L`, `Libs`, `Devs`, `S` and the desktop. |
| Extras | volume root | Merged in after Workbench. |
| Fonts | `Fonts` | |
| Locale | `Locale` | TOS 3.x only. |
| Storage | `Storage` | Drivers and monitors held back until they are wanted. |
| Classes | `Classes` | BOOPSI classes and datatypes. |
| GlowIcons | volume root | The TOS 3.5 icon set. |
| Backdrops | `Backdrops` | |
| Install | `Install` | Kept in its own drawer on purpose. |

**The order is fixed and it matters.** Workbench is copied before Extras so that
its full `C:`, `L:` and `Libs:` are not overwritten by the cut-down copies the
other disks carry, and the Install disk is kept in its own drawer for the same
reason. Only the Workbench disk is required; anything else you do not have is
simply left out. If the automatic choice is wrong, change which disc plays each
part before installing.

`T`, `Trashcan`, `Devs/DOSDrivers` and `Prefs/Env-Archive` are created
afterwards, because the install script makes them and no disk provides them. A
system with no `T:` cannot write a temporary file.

**Files already on the volume are left alone.** The volume is written into
rather than formatted, so a drive you have already partitioned, named and put
work on is added to rather than replaced, and installing twice does not undo
hand edits made in between.

A hard drive boots from the flag in its Rigid Disk Block rather than from a
floppy boot block, so if the partition is not marked bootable the install says
so rather than leaving you with a drive that silently will not start.

## TOS 3.5 and 3.9, which came on CD

These two releases are not installed the way 3.1 is, and it is worth being
plain about why. There is no tree to copy. The disc carries a Commodore
Installer script of two hundred kilobytes that runs on the Atari, reads the
versions of the libraries the live system has loaded, asks a great many
questions and patches an existing installation in place. Its own words are
that "Pretend mode cannot be used with this installation script", and 3.9
refuses outright unless it finds an earlier release to update.

So Atari File Forge does not install them. What it does is everything up to
that point, which is the part that otherwise costs an afternoon to discover.

Choose **Tools -> Install TOS 3.5 or 3.9** with a partition open, then
point it at the ISO of the disc you own. Nothing is downloaded, and no TOS
is shipped.

Three things are checked before anything starts:

- **The disc.** It is identified by the volume name Commodore wrote,
  `TOS3.5` or `TOS3.9`, and then confirmed by looking for that
  release's own drawer. A contribution CD or an OS4 disc is not accepted on a
  similar name alone.
- **The processor.** Both releases need a 68020 or better. An A1200, A3000,
  A4000 or CD32 qualifies on its own, and so does any machine carrying a
  68020, 68030, 68040 or 68060 accelerator, or a PiStorm. A stock A500 or A600
  cannot run either release, and is told so rather than left to find out from
  a machine that will not start.
- **The drive.** Both releases update a system rather than creating one, so a
  volume with no `S:Startup-Sequence` has nothing for them to update. Install
  Workbench 3.1 onto it first, which this application can do.

Every blocking reason is reported at once rather than one at a time, because
fixing one and running again is exactly the slow loop the check exists to
avoid.

When all three are in order, **Boot with the CD** starts the machine with the
drive booting and the disc in the CD drive, which is the state the installer
expects. Open the disc on the Workbench and run its installation icon; it will
ask where to install and what to include.

### Making the disc visible

A stock Workbench 3.1 installation has everything needed to read a CD and none
of it switched on, which is worth knowing because the symptom is a machine that
boots perfectly and shows no disc at all.

The Extras disk puts the CD filing system in `L:`, and the Storage disk puts
the `CD0` mountlist in `Storage/DOSDrivers`, which is the drawer Workbench keeps
things in until they are wanted. GEMDOS reads only `Devs/DOSDrivers`, so the
driver is present and inactive.

Booting with a CD activates it. The mountlist is copied into
`Devs/DOSDrivers/CD0`, and because Commodore leaves its `Device` and `Unit`
lines commented out and takes them from tooltypes on the `CD0` icon, defaulting
to a real SCSI drive at unit 2, those two lines are written into the mountlist
itself. That is the form the file's own comment documents.

This writes to the image, so it takes an undo checkpoint like any other write,
and it is reported before it happens rather than done silently.

The device it points at, `uaescsi.device` unit 0, is what FS-UAE presents a CD
on for a machine that has no CD drive of its own. If a disc still does not
appear, that value is the thing to check: it lives in
`Devs/DOSDrivers/CD0` on the drive and can be edited there.

## Method 1: stage it for installing later

This is the default, and for a multi-disc set it is usually the right answer.

**The discs are staged onto the drive itself, in `Storage/Install/<Title>`.** That is
the whole point of the mode. Boot the drive in an emulator, or put it in a real
Atari, and the material is already in front of you: you can run the title's own
installer against the staging drawer on the machine the title will actually run
on. A staging directory on the computer running Atari File Forge would be
unreachable at exactly the moment it was wanted.

`Storage` is where Workbench keeps what is not in use yet, which is what a
staged set is, and it is where the PiStorm imager puts the same thing. A plain
`Install` drawer at the volume root would have been the obvious choice, but the
TOS Install disk is copied there by a Workbench install, and staging into
the same drawer listed that disk's own `c` and `Libs` as though they were
titles somebody had staged.

Stage the second disc under the same title and its files are merged into the
same tree, which is what an installer expects to be pointed at. Nothing is
emulated, nothing is downloaded, and nothing is guessed at, so this mode always
works and always works quickly.

Where two discs carry the same path with genuinely different contents, the first
is kept and the later one is filed under
`Storage/Install/Forge-Staging/<Title>/<Disc>`.
A set is never silently reduced to whichever disc you staged last. The staging
summary lists every conflict so you can see what happened.

Nothing belonging to Atari File Forge is put inside the payload drawer, because
that drawer has to be exactly what gets installed. The record of what was
staged, and the files a later disc disagreed about, both live in
`Storage/Install/Forge-Staging`, which can be deleted once a set is in.

Protection bits and comments are written onto the volume with the files, because
an Atari filing system has somewhere to put them. A loader that lost its `e` bit
will not start, and the failure looks nothing like a missing permission, so this
matters more than it sounds.

Staging a disc under a label that is already there replaces it, files and all.
Re-staging Disk 1 after correcting it leaves you with one Disk 1 holding the
corrected files, and any conflict previously recorded against that disc is
dropped. A set that grew every time it was fixed, or that filed your correction
away as an alternative to the broken file, would be impossible to reason about
by the time you came to install it.

Come back to a set with **Tools -> Staged installations**, with the drive open.
That lists every title waiting on it, what discs it holds and where its files
are, and installs one into a drawer you name. The list is read off the drive
rather than out of a record kept on this computer, so a drive built on another
machine, or one whose staging notes were deleted, still reports what is sitting
in its staging drawer.

Installing moves the title out of the staging drawer into its own home on the
same volume. Because both ends are on one drive it is a move rather than a copy:
nothing is read or written twice, and the protection bits, comments and
datestamps the discs carried are the ones already there. It also names any file
that differed between discs, so a set that needed a judgement call says so
rather than looking complete.

Discarding a title deletes the staged copies from the drive. The original disc
images are untouched, so the set can be staged again.

## Method 2: install with WHDLoad

WHDLoad is how most Atari games and demos are made to run from a hard drive. It
comes in two halves, and only one of them can be fetched for you.

**The program** is published by its author at `whdload.de`. Atari File Forge
checks whether the drive already has `C:WHDLoad`, reads its version from the
program's own `$VER:` string, and installs the current release if there is none.
Aminet is used as a fallback if the author's site cannot be reached. The
`C:` tools and the `S:` startup and cleanup scripts are copied directly rather
than by running the archive's `Install` script under emulation: the destinations
are fixed and known, so booting a machine to rediscover them would cost a minute
per image and add a way to fail that copying does not have.

An existing `S:WHDLoad.prefs` is never overwritten. If you have tuned where
WHDLoad writes its debug output on that machine, reinstalling leaves your file
alone.

**A slave** is the small per-title patch that teaches WHDLoad one game, and it
cannot be downloaded. The author's site refuses its `/games/` index to anything
that is not a browser session, and Aminet does not carry slaves. Atari File
Forge does not pretend otherwise and offers no button that would always fail. A
slave reaches an image because it is already there, or because you supply one.
You can hand it either the bare `.slave` file or the small LHA it was published
in, and the archive is unpacked on the way through, so you do not need an LHA
tool of your own.

An install without a slave is reported as incomplete rather than presented as
finished. The title's drawer is created and its files are staged into it, ready
for the slave whenever you have it.

## Method 3: run the disc's own installer

Some software cannot be second-guessed at all. Productivity titles ask which
drawer, which language, which screen mode, and no tool has an answer to those
on your behalf.

This mode stops trying. It boots the drive in the emulator with the disc already
in `DF0:` and hands you the keyboard. The drive is attached whole, the same way
a hard-drive launch already works, so the installer sees the partitions and the
Workbench you actually built. Up to four discs can be inserted at once, filling
`DF0:` to `DF3:`, so a disc swap is a menu choice rather than a restart.

Because the emulator boots the drive rather than the disc, the drive needs a
working Workbench on it before this is useful; see
[Preparing the drive](#preparing-the-drive-install-workbench). It also needs a Kickstart ROM for
the machine in your hardware profile; see the [firmware notes](../firmware/README.md).

Whichever mode you choose, the disc is staged first. An install that fails
halfway has still preserved the disc's contents somewhere you can finish by hand.

## What gets an undo point

Staging a disc, installing a staged title, installing Workbench, installing
WHDLoad and placing a slave all change a volume, and each takes an undo
checkpoint before it runs. Staging now takes one too, because it writes onto the
drive being built rather than into a directory on this computer. Booting the
emulator changes nothing Atari File Forge owns, so it takes none.

## Reading LHA archives

Atari File Forge decodes LHA itself rather than calling out to `lha` or
`lhasa`. That keeps the container, the Debian package and the Snap behaving
identically instead of leaving one of them with a missing tool nobody notices
until a user hits it. Header levels 0, 1 and 2 are read, and the `-lh0-`,
`-lh4-`, `-lh5-`, `-lh6-` and `-lh7-` methods are decompressed, which is
everything the Atari world produced. Every member is checked against the CRC the
archive stores for it, so a damaged download is reported rather than written
into a disk image.

A method this build cannot expand still lists correctly and names itself when
you try to read it, because "this archive uses `-lh1-`" is a fact you can act
on and "something went wrong" is not.
