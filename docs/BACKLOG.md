# Atari File Forge backlog

This product backlog was established after the `1.0.0-rc.1` feature review and
reviewed again against `1.0.0-rc.2` on 17 August 2026. It is separate from the
[release checklist](RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md): the checklist is a repeatable
validation gate, while this page records product work that is not finished.

Items are split so completed work can be checked without hiding the remaining
part of a larger idea. A checked item is implemented and covered by the normal
project documentation. An unchecked item remains in scope.

## 1. Release engineering

- [x] Remove the obsolete statement that the workspace is limited to three
      panes. The workspace now documents its unlimited movable, resizable,
      stackable and minimisable pane model.
- [x] Provide a reproducible, version-neutral release checklist.
- [x] Make the Dockerfile build native dependencies on AMD64, ARM64 and ARMv7,
      including the Raspberry Pi package-name and Capstone fixes.
- [ ] Run and retain the complete AMD64, ARM64 and ARMv7 clean-build matrix for
      the release candidate.
- [x] Run the generated-media and fault-injection gates for the candidate.
      Both run in CI on every commit, inside the application image, so the
      evidence is the run attached to the released commit.
- [ ] Complete the real-hardware gate for the affected Atari, Atari 600,
      Hardfile, FastFileSystem and TOS workflows.
- [ ] Choose the release version, update `VERSION`, create the signed or
      annotated tag, publish release notes and retain the previous known-good
      release for rollback.

## 2. Image comparison and patch sets

- [x] Compare logical filesystem objects across open OFS, HDF, FFS, ROM and
      Kickstart ROMs.
- [x] Report added, removed, content-modified and metadata-only records using
      deterministic manifests and SHA-256 fingerprints.
- [x] Export the complete comparison as JSON.
- [x] Build a compact `.affpatch.zip` containing only changed payloads and a
      human-readable operation plan.
- [x] Verify the exact base revision, physical layout, operation plan and every
      payload before enabling Apply.
- [x] Create an automatic checkpoint, verify the final candidate fingerprint
      and roll back a failed or aborted application.
- [x] Show persistent phase, item and byte progress with safe Abort for compare,
      patch creation, preflight and application.
- [x] Classify proven renames directly instead of presenting every rename as a
      remove plus add pair.
- [x] Add filesystem-contextual raw-byte differences to the same comparison
      report, separated by primary image and companion descriptor. Equal
      chunks are skipped without byte-by-byte expansion and changed ranges are
      reported alongside the logical filesystem evidence.
- [x] Allow a reviewed subset of independent operations to be exported and
      applied. Each subset receives its own derived candidate fingerprint and
      automatically includes required parent directories, removed descendants
      and complete HDF-slot dependencies.

## 3. Workspace-wide search

- [x] Search filenames and bounded readable BASIC, script and text content
      across every distinct open filesystem image.
- [x] Search every formatted HDF slot without opening each disk individually.
- [x] Restore, raise and navigate the containing pane, slot and directory, then
      open the selected file.
- [x] Search catalogue metadata, protection bits, comments, icon types and
      access state.
- [x] Add known publisher and installed-menu metadata to workspace search,
      including launch action and STACK evidence from recognised HDF and FFS
      menus.
- [x] Search exact and prefix SHA-256 values from a manifest or collection
      index.
- [x] Search useful printable strings in binary files and jump to the matching
      disassembly or Hex address.
- [x] Add raw ROM bank strings, ROM symbols and regions, disassembly labels,
      project notes and comments to workspace search, with direct navigation
      to the matching bank, Workbench tab and address.

## 4. Headless CLI and repeatable recipes

- [x] Save reusable GUI import recipes for naming, grouping, online metadata,
      compatibility rewrites and menu policy.
- [x] Export and restore a portable GUI project containing panes, paths,
      profiles and recipes.
- [x] Provide a supported headless CLI for image creation, imports, conversion,
      validation, menu generation, comparison, patching and saving.
- [x] Export a completed GUI workflow as a versioned recipe with source
      identities, expected hashes and all non-secret decisions required for a
      deterministic rebuild.
- [x] Add a dry-run CLI report and stable machine-readable exit statuses.

## 5. Compatibility and conversion reports

- [x] Preflight cross-format transfers for target names, truncation, collisions,
      directory capacity, empty disks and destination conflicts.
- [x] Report load and execution metadata, safe OFS-to-FFS loader rewrites,
      STACK evidence, profile conflicts and image warnings in the applicable
      workflows and saved README.
- [x] Define a versioned consolidated compatibility-report schema and use it
      for the current selection dry-run.
- [x] Present that shared report before every cross-format batch from drag and
      drop, File commands and Online Library. The headless CLI already uses it
      for imports and exposes it directly through `preflight`.
- [x] Export a generated compatibility report directly as JSON or Markdown.
- [x] Include the final accepted report in the saved image package.
- [x] Record explicit filename, directory and filetype losses or conversions
      per item rather than only as batch-level prose.

## 6. Whole-HDF emulator integration

- [x] Run or debug one selected HDF slot by extracting an isolated temporary
      ADF without changing the HDF.
- [x] Disable whole-HDF launch honestly when the selected emulator has no FastFileSystem
      storage adapter.
- [x] Add an FastFileSystem-compatible virtual SD-card adapter to FS-UAE or vAtari.
- [x] Mount, boot and debug the complete HDF, including its actual menu and
      selected FastFileSystem build.
- [x] Feed authoritative whole-HDF emulator results back into menu health and
      STACK diagnostics.

## 7. Preparing a drive and installing floppies onto it

- [x] Offer installing a disc as a third choice beside copying its contents and
      storing the image, wherever the destination is a mounted volume on a hard
      drive.
- [x] Install TOS onto a drive from the operator's own Workbench floppies,
      recognising each disk by the volume name inside it, keeping the set to
      one release, and copying the disks in the order that leaves the shared
      files correct.
- [x] Stage a disc into a drawer on the target image rather than into a
      directory on the machine running the application, so the install can be
      finished in an emulator or on the real hardware, with protection bits and
      comments written onto the volume with the files.
- [x] Read the staged list off the drive rather than out of a record kept on
      this machine, so a drive built elsewhere still reports what is waiting on
      it.
- [x] Keep both files when two discs of one set carry the same path with
      different contents, rather than reducing the set to its last disc.
- [x] Treat restaging a disc under an existing label as a correction that
      replaces its files and clears any conflict recorded against it.
- [x] List staged titles, install one into an open volume and discard one,
      so a set can be finished after the last disc is staged.
- [x] Install the WHDLoad program from its author's site, with Aminet as a
      fallback, detecting the installed version and preserving local
      preferences.
- [x] Accept a WHDLoad slave bare or inside the archive it was published in.
- [x] Boot a drive under emulation with a title's discs inserted, for software
      that can only be installed by its own installer.
- [x] Read LHA archives in this tree, so the feature does not depend on a
      decompressor present in the container and absent from the native builds.
- [ ] Report WHDLoad slave coverage for a staged title once a local slave
      collection can be nominated, so a set that cannot yet run says so before
      it is installed.
- [ ] Give the drawers a Workbench install creates their own icons, so software
      installed into them can be reached from the desktop rather than only from
      a Shell or with Show All Files.
- [ ] Mark a prepared partition bootable in its Rigid Disk Block. The install
      reports when the flag is missing, but cannot yet set it.

## 8. Writable archives and DMS projects

- [x] Browse ZIP, TAR, compressed TAR, GZIP, BZIP2 and XZ hierarchies with
      bounded extraction and path safety.
- [x] Edit supported readable archive members, rebuild the outer container,
      verify hashes and checkpoint the containing image.
- [x] Decode raw, compressed and extensionless DMS into a read-only track
      listing, and rebuild the disk it was made from.
- [x] Rebuild DMS while preserving track order, omitted empty tracks,
      carrier tones, security cycles and unknown control chunks byte for byte
      where they are not intentionally changed.
- [x] Provide a DMS-project view and a structural before-save comparison that
      makes every timing or control-chunk change explicit.
- [x] Enable DMS member editing only when the reconstruction proof succeeds;
      retain read-only behaviour for ambiguous or unsupported recordings.

## 9. Expanded menu interpretation

- [x] Detect, edit and preview supported Workbench, Workbench 4R, WHDLoad and other
      explicitly modelled menu records.
- [x] Show a database-oriented fallback when a machine-code menu cannot be
      interpreted safely.
- [x] Run unfamiliar menu programs in an isolated emulator sandbox with bounded
      time, deterministic media and no access to working images.
- [x] Capture display, palette, text and input behaviour from the sandbox and
      link it to the menu database records that produced each screen entry.
- [ ] Promote a captured interpreter profile only after repeatable evidence and
      regression fixtures exist for that menu family.

## 10. Collection database

- [x] Export manifests containing logical paths, HDF slots, metadata, hashes
      and recognised menu records.
- [x] Detect byte-identical files and disks, equivalent HDF catalogue content,
      likely title variants and duplicate games across differently named disks.
- [x] Filter Online Library results against remembered distributions, disk
      titles and installed menu entries.
- [x] Maintain a host-private catalogue of owned images, titles, publishers,
      target machines, hashes, menu entries and user-supplied locations.
- [x] Refresh the catalogue incrementally after edits and invalidate stale
      records using the exact image revision fingerprint.
- [x] Produce collection, duplicate, variant and missing-title reports across
      images that are not currently open.
- [x] Add explicit export, import, backup and clear controls for the private
      catalogue without exposing one web profile's or Linux user's records to
      another.

## 11. Hardware deployment assistant

- [x] Model target machines, filing systems, expansions, accelerator state and managed
      emulator capabilities in hardware profiles.
- [x] Validate images and saved packages against the selected profile and
      generate a technical README with applicable warnings.
- [x] Model deployment layouts for Gotek, FastFileSystem, Hardfile, PiStorm and supported
      TOS targets, including filenames, directories, companion files and
      capacity rules.
- [x] Generate the chosen SD-card or host-directory tree in a downloadable ZIP
      without changing the open working images.
- [x] Include a hardware-specific installation, backup, verification and
      rollback guide generated from the exact profile and package contents.
- [x] Validate the generated layout itself before download and report anything
      that still requires a manual hardware step.

## 12. Cheat analysis and verified patches

- [x] Find conservative ST BASIC gameplay variables, direct memory writes and
      terminal-value tests from one selected file.
- [x] Find counter, comparison, branch and semantically labelled state evidence
      in supported 68000, 68010, 68020, 68030, 68040 and 68060 disassembly.
- [x] Present confidence, purpose filters, risk, online title identification
      and configured specialist reference searches as a read-only Analyse tool.
- [ ] Correlate static candidates with emulator watchpoints and repeatable
      gameplay events before offering a patch.
- [x] Save a proved cheat as a guarded project patch with original-byte hash,
      machine profile, rationale, author and rollback instructions.
- [x] Add a user-owned cheat library that matches exact image and file hashes,
      never title alone.

## 13. Linux desktop host

- [x] Add a GTK 4 and Libadwaita application host around the shared frontend.
- [x] Run the shared Flask application on an authenticated random loopback
      port with XDG working storage.
- [x] Open registered Atari image types through a native multi-file chooser
      and a desktop-only, authenticated local-path adapter.
- [x] Review native selections through the shared frontend, including target
      hardware and multi-chip ROM layout, then execute open plans serially.
- [x] Separate the per-launch authentication token from a stable private owner
      and retain workspace settings and collection data in XDG configuration.
- [x] Keep browser and desktop behaviour under an explicit route, capability,
      documentation and test contract.
- [x] Launch managed emulators on the native display while retaining noVNC for
      the Docker edition.
- [x] Provide a user-local installer, launcher, icon, MIME definitions and
      uninstaller for Debian and Ubuntu class desktops.
- [x] Write supported floppy images and selected HDF slots through an optional
      Greaseweazle, with drive validation, destructive confirmation, stable
      source snapshots, tracked progress, cancellation and format-appropriate
      verification.
- [x] Publish the project MIT licence, contribution and security policies,
      third-party boundary, issue forms and pull-request quality gate.
- [ ] Produce signed distribution packages after the release-signing policy is
      finalised.

## Delivery order

Work should normally proceed in this order:

1. Present the shared compatibility report consistently before every remaining
   cross-format GUI workflow.
2. Build the deployment assistant on hardware profiles, compatibility reports
   and deterministic recipes.
3. Develop writable DMS projects and sandboxed menu interpretation as isolated
   expert projects with their own fixtures and safety gates.
4. Add a real FastFileSystem storage adapter and use whole-HDF emulator results for menu
   and STACK diagnostics.
5. Correlate static cheat candidates with repeatable emulator evidence before
   permitting guarded patches or a private cheat library.
6. Run the complete multi-architecture and real-hardware release gates, then
   publish the tagged release candidate.

Safety takes precedence over marking a checkbox. Unsupported token streams,
dms control data, menu programs and emulator adapters must remain read-only or
disabled until the relevant proof and rollback path exist.
